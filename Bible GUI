also some tips below


Inside your sermons there will be a problem, words like names, religeous words like baptist or Jesus, and violent stuff like suicide or crucify+ will get
censored, so a good workaround is to change words, EXAMPLE: Jesus --> Jes##s

A easy way to do this would be to use notepad++ or roblox studio's find and replace.

			"The grand palace of the King trembled as flames licked its surface of gold and silver.", 
" The kingdom's long suppressed subjects had reached the King's dungeon, where he tried to hide as his guards stood defenseless against the mob.", 
" They dragged him, the once King, now deprived of his crown and throne, through the carefully polished marble floor,", 
" putting rusted chains around his hands and ankles. The very chains that the King had used to imprison his opponents. ", 
" They rid him of his long gorgeous robe, using mere rags to cover his now scarred body. The old King murmured,", 
" but his mouth was soon slammed shut by the angry crowd.", 

"The riot went on, with exploited farmers and workers and even the once loyal and lawful citizens, ", 
"rushing into the palace to grab their share of the treasure. ", 
"The followers and servants of the King were all butchered with knives and swords or even by heavy sticks and stones.", 
" Even the jester of the court was not spared. He was caught crying as the people put his head against the beautifully decorated palace wall.", 
" His mask lay broken on the ground, and his blood soon stained the royal carpets as the fire grew silently, taking the palace slowly apart.", 

"But the wiser men of the city did not join this parade of madness. Unlike the uneducated crowd,", 
" they knew very well what the things in the King’s dungeon meant. Not just corruption and indulgence of pleasure,", 
" but something darker, whispers and prayers to things that should not be remembered.", 
" The tomes and symbols reminded them too much of the ancient gods of down in the abyss,", 
" the dark red liquid in the silver cup unsettlingly resembled blood. A lion, which was once the King’s pet,", 
" now reduced to mere skeleton, had carvings on it that they wish they could unsee.", 
" And they knew that the soldiers fell before the angry people not because their weapons were not sharp or their armors were poorly-made, ", 
" but because their bodies so weak, that they weren’t even able to put up a fight. ", 
" The soldiers were hardly the young men in good health they were when they were recruited, ", 
" as they appeared lost and confused with a broken soul, as if something had sucked their life dry over the years.", 
" So they fled, scholars grabbing their scrolls, painters taking their paintings and tools, leaving this cursed city without looking back.", 

"The cheering in the city however, did not cease. The people celebrated their victory, throwing filthy things towards the King,", 
" picking up stones to break his fragile bones once more. Even the smallest children had come up and kicked the old man,", 
" leaving him crawling in the mud. They hardly understood what this all meant, but they too laughed with the crowd. ", 
" The crows gathered on the branches nearby, and they made noises harsh and shrill, as if mocking the men below.", 

"Tortured people had taken their revenge, but even those who had been the King’s accomplice had joined their rank. ", 
"The criminals who had murdered tens of people stood alongside those who were too afraid to even speak ill of the court,", 
" and they all cheered and cheered. The thieves walked proudly in broad daylight, for on this one day, the only thief was the King,", 
" who stole the Kingdom from its people, and everything else done was to serve justice. ", 
" Innocents had died and the ones with blood on their hands were praised heroes, but the crowd did not care. ", 
" They were vultures, feasting upon the dead body of a giant, who had been weak and sinful,", 
" now a lair for things so much more filthy than he was.", 

"And the climax of the feast came when the King was taken through the long streets and out to a small hill where an old tree stood.", 
" They were going to use the gallows to hang him, but someone suggested that the King did not deserve a formal execution,", 
" but should die nameless and forgotten. So they took him here, a deserted place where the tree happened to be big and tall enough for him to be hanged. ", 
" The King, who had crawled on his broken knees all the way there, hardly resembled a king anymore. Covered in dirt and rags,", 
" he was more along the lines of beggars than anything of royalty. But even as people spat at him and cursed him, ", 
" nobody dared to look at him in the eyes. Even with his jaw broken, he murmured unholy words that no one wished to hear.", 
" So the crowd shouted and yelled as loud as they could, trying to hide the unsettling feeling stirring their hearts and minds.", 

"The execution was done easily and swiftly, as it merely took a long rope around the King's neck with its end tied to a large tree branch.", 
" The King was hanged, heavy chains still on his body, for the people felt unsafe to take them off.", 
" He had struggled like every hanged man in human history, but the words slipped through his lips were unlike anything others had spoken. ", 
" He did not ask for forgiveness, nor did he curse his rebellious subjects for he knew they had already been cursed.", 
" He spoke inhuman words that came from places of dark, and then laughed and laughed until his final breath.", 
" Then there was silence, as his hands and feet finally stopped moving.", 

"There was no longer cheering, as everyone tried to get out of the place as soon as they could.", 
" Nobody wanted to look at the Hanged King for a second more, as his eyes, now lifeless and wide, ", 
" still seemed to be staring at them. The courage they built up when taking the palace was gone, ", 
" the pride and the triumph they felt now reduced to void and fear. The King was hanged,", 
" but it was as if his laughter was still echoing on this small hill.", 

"They never intended to bury him as they eventually did, for they wanted him to be exposed in the wild for crows to come and maggots to grow,", 
" and his body to decay, so that the King would die humiliated. The crows did come, circling around him but never landed. ", 
" They just laughed and laughed with their ugly voices as if mocking the crowd once more. ", 
" And the lifeless look of the King was so resentful and disgusting that everyone wanted to cover this foul creature with earth,", 
" as if mere soil would help them escape from his hateful gaze. They did not make him a tomb, however, ", 
" and they buried the King only shallowly as nobody was willing to stay long to dig a hole deep enough. ", 
" Then the crowd left. They went back to the city, and indulged themselves in their newly gained treasure,", 
" trying to forget what they had witnessed.", 

"On the first day, nothing had really happened, except that a homeless man reported that he had heard strange noises coming from the hill,", 
" where the King was hanged and buried. He also said that crows had gathered, ", 
" their eyes fixed on the King’s grave, as if waiting for something to happen. But this was dismissed as a madman’s words.", 

"On the second day, however, many residents of the city found themselves badly ill. ", 
"They coughed, bled, and trembled lying on the floor as if they were bound by heavy, ", 
"rusted chains. The river that flowed across the city had turned red, and smelled of human blood. ", 
"Those who enjoyed their new power and wealth found themselves helpless after merely one day,", 
" clutching at the gold they took from the palace and died beside it.", 

"On the third day, those who were still alive were able to move again. ", 
"But they stood up only to put a knife against their throats or to scream while ripping their faces off.", 
" Their blood streamed out of their houses, staining the river with red even more. All animals had fled the city, ", 
" except for the crows, which were now almost everywhere. They stood watching silently as the city spiraled down into madness. ", 
" At the same time, the soil on top of the King’s burial rustled. The crows laughed with their harsh tone as the Hanged King climbed out of his grave,", 
" with chains around his hands and ankles and the rope around his neck.", 

"He was hanged as a king of men but he came out of that place something else. ", 
"His body lifeless, but he was not dead as he refused to walk that path, and used souls he had and didn’t have to make the bargain.", 
" The chains hit the ground, clashing against each other as the Hanged King made his way back to the city.", 
" The very city now flooded with blood and watched by dark crows, where people kept screaming until they could scream no more.", 
"He moved past the streets where he was dragged along just a few days back, stepping on the blood of his former subjects.", 
" He walked slowly towards the ruins of the once magnificent palace he had built all those years ago.", 
" The treasures had been taken, and all that was left were dead bodies and broken weapons. ", 
" The King moved past a broken mask, which was once worn by his favorite jester, but he paid no attention. ", 
" He walked towards the dungeon where a throne covered by sharp, rusted spikes was placed. ", 
" The ones who had taken the palace thought it was meant for torturing, and did not bother to move it.", 
" The King, leaving a blood trail behind, stepped upon to the throne, and placed his body through the cold metal spikes.", 

"As the spikes went through his dead body, the King trembled. He would have screamed, if the rope had not rendered him breathless,", 
" for the pain was in the soul rather than his body. He was there to suffer forever, ", 
" but it had been done and it was then his one and only rightful throne. For a moment there,", 
" there was silence, but then the ruins of the palace began to shake, and the city started to tremble.", 
" The flames rose once more, but more of a phantom of the past, and the blood in the river started to boil.", 
" The skeleton of the lion stood up, and roared.", 

"The King’s dungeon, where the throne was placed, the center of all these, now became a hole,", 
" a hole that warped the whole kingdom inside. It turned everything inside out,", 
" making them twisted and inhuman. The space bent, time disoriented, and the city was in another place not quite there, ", 
" but still where they all were. The whole city was transformed and remade. The crows had taken off and they circled the city, ", 
" searching for those who were not yet dead, pecking them with their beaks until they bled out in horrifying forms.", 

"The Hanged King, who was now seated in the court of his new city, built upon the ruins of the old one,", 
" shall sit there forever and ever. The dead jester came up, once again wore his broken mask,", 
" and offered the King a silver cup filled with blood.", 

"He spoke words not quite his in an alien tone: “With this, our blood, it is the Hanged King’s.”", 

"The King took the cup, but his hand was broken and pierced by the sharp blades of the throne.", 
"The scarred hand trembled hard, and it was too weak to hold it. The cup then fell on the floor and the blood spilled on his new court.", 

"The crows, who had been watching, laughed again with their harsh voices and left. ", 
"They left the city as the dead stood up again, bending their broken body to resemble human form. ", 
"They walked the new twisted streets, putting on masks to cover their bloodied faces, ", 
"and started to cheer as they did when they were alive on the day they took the palace.", 
" They paraded in the new city and started a carnival, as if the tragedy was a grand masquerade all along.", 
" They laughed and laughed until the King started to cry and scream, but his throat could not make a single sound,", 
" so he merely wept in silence.", 

"So the city was ruled forever by the Hanged King, with the masked dead celebrating and parading until they too rot.", 
" But even those who had fled the city when the King was hanged found no peace. ", 
" They were haunted in waking moments and in dreams, for whispers from the twisted city had found their hidings. ", 
" They dreamt of a masquerade of corrupted souls, through the long hallways of a labyrinth down to the Hanged King’s grand court. ", 
" And when they woke up, they would shake in fear. But they could not forget what they had seen,", 
" as if the city of decay and rapture had taken roots in their minds. So they wrote dramas and poems about the cursed city,", 
" composed songs and paintings of the damned king. Some of them lost and forgotten,", 
" but those survived the long history will bring their viewers to the Hanged King’s reach.", 

"And outside the twisted alleys of the kingdom, beyond the spiked throne of the Hanged King, the crows all laugh and fly away,", 
"but their eyes shall always be watching."

				"When I was 18... 18 years old, I saw for the first time in my life... ",
				"I saw an image of clarity. I saw a comic strip... a three panel comic strip that,",
				"though simple as it seemed, changed me... changed my being, changed who I am... Made me who I am...",

				"Enlightened me...",

				"The strip, Garfield, the comic strip was new... no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since...",
				"since coming into existence... and there it was before me in print, I saw it... a comic strip... What was it called?",

				"Garfield.",

				"The story here is of a man, a plain man. He is Jon, but he is more than that... I will get to this later,",
				"but first let us say that he's Jon, a plain man.",

				"And then there is a cat... Garfield.",

				"This is the nature of the world, here. When I see the world, the politics, the future, the... the satellites in space, and...",
				"the people who put them there...",

				"You can look at everything as a man and a cat... two beings, in harmony and at war...",

				"So, this strip I saw; this man, Jon, and the cat, Garfield, you see...",

				"Yes... hmm...",

				"It is about everything. This... little comic is, oh, lo and behold... not so little anymore.",

				"So yes, when I was 18, I saw this comic... and it hit me all at once, its power. I clipped it, and every day, I looked at it,",
				"and I said Okay... let me look at this here. What is this doing to me? Why is this so powerful?",

				"Jon Arbuckle, he sits here, legs crossed... comfortable in his home, and he reads his newspaper... The news of the world, perhaps...",
				"and then he extends his fingers lightly, delicately... he taps his fingers on an end table, and he feels for something...",

				"What is it? It is something he needs, but it is not there.",

				"And then he looks up, slightly cockeyed, and he thinks... His newspaper's in his lap now, and he thinks this...",

				"Now where could my pipe be?",

				"This... I always come to this, because I was a young man... I'm older now, and I still don't have the secrets, the answers,",
				"so this question still rings true, Jon looks up and he thinks...",

				"Now where could my pipe be?",

				"And then it happens... You see it, you see... it's almost like divine intervention, suddenly it is there, and it overpowers you...",


				"A cat is smoking a pipe.",

				"It is the man's pipe, it's Jon's pipe, but the cat... this cat, Garfield, is smoking the pipe... and from afar, and someplace near,",
				"but not clear... near but not clear... The man calls out... Jon calls out, he is shocked. Garfield! he shouts.",

				"Garfield. The cat's name.",

				"But, let's take a step back... let us examine this from all sides, all perspectives... and when I first came across this comic strip,",
				"I was at my father's house... a newspaper had arrived, and I picked it up for him, and brought it inside.",

				"I organized its sections for him and then, yes, the comic strip section fell out from somewhere in the middle,",
				"and landed on the kitchen floor... I picked up the paper pages and saw, up somewhere near the top of this strip...",
				"just like Jon, I was wearing an aquamarine shirt.",

				"So I thought, Ah, interesting. I'll have to see this later. I snipped out the little comic, and held on to it... and five days later,",
				"I reexamined it... and it gripped me, I needed to find out more about this. The information I had was minimal, but enough...",

				"An orange cat named Garfield...",

				"Okay, that seemed to be the l#nchpin of this whole operation, yes. Another clue... a signature in the bottom right corner,",
				"a man's name...",

				"J#m D#avis.",

				"Yes, I'm on to it for sure.",

				"So... one: Garfield, orange cat, and two: J#m D#avis, the creator of this cat...",

				"And that curiously plain man.",

				"I did not know, at the time, that his name was Jon. This strip, you see, had no mention of this man's name, and I'd never seen it before.",


				"But I had these clues; J#m D#avis, Garfield.",

				"And then I saw more, I spotted the tiny copyright mark in the upper left corner. Copyright 1978 to... what is this?",
				"Copyright belongs to a... PAWS Incorporated...",

				"I use the local library and mail services to track down the information I was looking for...",

				"J#m D#avis, a cartoonist, had created a comic strip about a cat, Garfield... and a man, Jon Arbuckle. Well,",
				"from that point on, I made sure I read the Garfield comic strips, though as I read each one, as each day passed...",
				"the strips seemed to resonate with me less and less...",

				"I sent letters to PAWS Incorporated, long letters, pages upon pages... asking if Mister J#m D#avis could somehow publish just the",
				"one comic, over and over again... It would be meditative, I wrote, the strength of that.",

				"Could you imagine?",

				"But... no response... The strips lost their power, and eventually I stopped reading, but... I did not want my perceptions",
				"diluted, so I vowed to read the pipe strip over and over again... That is what I call it, The Pipe Strip.",

				"The Pipe Strip.",

				"Everything about it is perfect. I can only describe it as a miracle creation, something came together...",
				"the elements aligned... It is like the comets, the cosmic orchestra that is up there over your head...",
				"The immense, enormous void is working all for one thing, to tell you one thing...",

				"Gas and rock, and purity, and nothing.",

				"I will say this... When I see the pipe strip... and I mean every single time I look at the lines,",
				"the colors, the shapes that make up the three panel comic...",

				"I see perfection.",

				"Do I find perfection in many things?",

				"Some things, I would say... Some things are perfect... and this is one of them.",
				"I can look at the little tuft of hair on Jon Arbuckle's head... it is the perfect shade..",
				". The purple pipe in Garfield's mouth...",
				"How could a mere mortal even MAKE this?",

				"I have a theory, about J#m D#avis...",

				"After copious research and, yes, of course, now we have the internet, and this information is all readily available, but...",

				"J#m D#avis, he used his life experiences to influence his comic...",

				"Like I mentioned before, none of them seem to have the weight of the pipe strip...",
				"But you have to wonder about the man who is able to even, just once, create the perfect form, a literally flawless execution of art",
				"brilliance! Just as in a ward... I think there is a spiritual element at work...",

				"I've seen my share of bad times and... when you have something... Well, it's just...",
				"emotions, and neurons in your brain, but... something tells you that it's the truth...",

				"Truth's radiant light.",

				"Garfield, the cat? Neurons in my brain, it's... it's harmony, you see? It...",
				"Jon and Garfield, it's truly harmony, like a... continuous, looping, everlasting harmony...",
				"The lavender chair, the brown end table, the salmon-colored wall, the fore's green carpeting,",
				"Garfield is hunched, perched... perhaps with the pipe stuck firmly between his jowls... ",
				"His tail curls around. It's more than shapes too, because... I...",

				"Okay, stay with me... I've done this experiment several times.",

				"You take the strip. You trace only the basic elements. You can do anything, you can simplify the shapes down to just... ",
				"blobs, just outlines, but it still makes sense...",

				"You can replace the blobs with magazine cutouts of other things, replace Jon Arbuckle with a...",
				"car parked in a driveway sideways, cut that out of a magazine, stick it in...",
				"Replace him there in the second panel with a... a food processor...",
				"Okay, and then we put a picture of the planet in the third panel over Garfield...",

				"It still works.",

				"These are universal proportions. I don't know... how best to explain why it works, I've studied the pipe strip,",
				"and analyzed Jon and Garfield's proportions against several universal mathematical constants.",

				"E, Pi, the Golden Ratio, the Feigenbaum Constants, and so on... and it's surprising... scary even, how things align.",
				"You can take just... tiny pieces of the pipe strip, for instance, take Jon's elbow from the second panel... and take that,",
				"and project it back over Jon's entire shape in the second panel, and you'll see a near perfect Fibonacci sequence emerge...",

				"It's eerie to me... and it makes you wonder if you're in the presence of a deity, if there is some larger hand at work...",

				"There's no doubt in my mind that J#m D#avis is a smart man...",

				"J#m D#avis is capable of anything to me... He is remarkable, but this is so far beyond that, I think we might see that... ",
				"this work of art is revered and respected in years to come.",

				"J#m D#avis is possibly a new master of the craft, a... a genius of the eye; ",
				"they very well may say the same things about J#m D#avis in five hundred years that we say about the great philosophical",
				"and artistic masters from centuries ago... J#m D#avis is a modern day Socrates, or... Da Vinci... mixing both striking ",
				"visual beauty with classical, daring, unheard-of intellect...",

				"Look, he combines these things to make profoundly simple expressions...",

				"This strip is his masterpiece... The Pipe Strip is his masterpiece... and it is a masterpiece and a marvel...",

				"I often look at Garfield's... particular pose, in this strip. He is poised, and statuesque...",
				"and his cat stare is reminiscent of the fiery gazes often found in religious iconography...",
				"But still, his eyes are playful, lying somewhere between the solemn father's expression in...",
				"Rembrandt's Return of the Prodigal Son and the coy smirk of Da Vinci's Saint John The B#pt#st.",

				"His ears stick up, signifying a peaked readiness... It's as if he could, at any moment, pounce; he is,",
				"after all, a close relative and descendant of the mighty jungle cats of Africa that could leap... after prey.",
				"You could see the power drawn into Garfield's hind quarters, powerful haunches indeed.",

				"The third panel.",

				"And I'm just saying this now, this is just coming to me now... The third panel of the pipe strip is essentially a",
				"microcosm for the entire strip itself... All the power dynamics, the struggle for superiority, right?",

				"WHO has the pipe? WHERE is the pipe? All of that is drawn, built, layered into Garfield's iconic pose here.",
				"You can see it in the curl of his tail... Garfield's ear whiskers stick up, on end, the smoke billows, upward...",
				"drawing the eye upward... increasing the scope...",

				"I'm just... amazed... really, that after 33 years of reading, and analyzing the same comic strip,",
				"I'm able to find new dimensions. It's a testament to the work...",

				"For six years, I delved into tobacco research, because... can a cat smoke? This is a metaphysical question...",
				"Yes, can any cat smoke? Do we know? Can just Garfield smoke?",

				"The research says no. Nicotine poisoning can kill animals, especially household pets.",
				"All it takes is the nicotine found in as little as a single cigarette.",

				"[ *Okamoto M, Kita T, Okuda H, Tanaka T, Nakashima T (Jul 1994). Effects of aging on acute toxicity of nicotine in rats.",
				"Pharmacol Toxicol. 75 (1): 1-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb00316.x. PMID 7971729 ]",

				"Surely, Jon's pipe hold a substantial amount of tobacco, and it is true that pets living in the homes of smokers are nearly",
				"25% more likely to develop some form of cancer... most likely due to secondhand smoke... but these are facts of smoking,",
				"its tolls on our world.",

				"But after visiting two tobacco processing plants in Virginia... and the Phillip Morris cigarette manufacturing facility,",
				"I came no closer to cracking the meaning. I was looking for any insight. A detective of a homicide case has to look at",
				"every angle, so I'm always taking apart the pipe strip.",
				"I focused on every minutiae, every detail of this strip.",

				"Jon Arbuckle's clothing... I have replicas. I'm an expert in textiles... so, you see, this smoking thing was a hang-up ",
				"for me... but it was the statement here... until...",

				"This is key, this is the breakthrough.",

				"The pipe is not a pipe, really.",

				"Obviously there is symbolism at work here... I saw that from the beginning,",
				"and I looked at the literal aspects of the strip to gain insight into the metaphors at play...",
				"I worked at a newspaper printing press for eighteen months, in the late 1980's... ",
				"I was learning the literal to inform the gestural... the subliteral, the in-between...",

				"Jon reading this newspaper means so much more than just... Jon reading the newspaper... ",
				"but how could you ever hope to decipher the puzzle without knowing everything there is to know about newspapers?!",

				"Okay... for example... Jon holds his newspaper up with his left hand, thumb gripping the interior.",
				"I learned that this particular grip here was the newspaper grip of nineteenth century aristocrats...",
				"and this aristocrat grip was a point of contention that influenced the decision to move forward with prohibition...",
				"in the United States, in the early twentieth century!",

				"So Jon's hand position is much more than that, it... it is a comment on class war... and the resulting reactionary culture...",
				"but I didn't know about the aristocratic newspaper grip until I came across some microfiche archives at the printing press.",

				"It's about information. You have to take it apart.",

				"...and the breakthrough on the smoking cat came late... just eight years ago, actually. Smoking cat is an industry term.",
				"It's what the smoking industry calls a tattletale teenager who tells on his friends after they've",
				"all tried smoking for the first time... and it is actually a foreign translation, bastardization of the term smoking rat... ",
				"But the phrase was confused when secret documents went back and forth between China and America...",

				"These documents are still secret, and the only reason I know about the term is because I know a man, my friend.",
				"Let's call him Timothy, yeah... yes, it's a fake name, for his protection. Timothy worked for Phillip Morris for sixteen years,",
				"and he had seen the documents... and when he told me, it was an Aha moment... and he said, But how? How could this cartoonist,",
				"J#m D#avis, know about this... obscure term from the mid-70's, used exclusively by a few cigarette companies!?",

				"This is still a mystery to me... but I connect the dots by noting J#m D#avis' childhood experiences on a farm. ",
				"He must have seen something...",

				"What could it be?",

				"Timothy went on to tell me there was one particular smoking cat, a boy, from... yes, Indiana,",
				"a boy named Ernie Barguckle, who became a thorn in the side of the tobacco companies ",
				"for a couple of years... He did more than tattle to his parents; he and his family took legal action,",
				"and they eventually received a huge settlement payout...",

				"But that name is too similar... Ernie Barguckle...",

				"Jon Arbuckle.",

				"J#m D#avis must have used this.",

				"There's more here. Ernie Barguckle spent nearly half of that settlement money on experimental",
				"medical procedures to cure his... impotence. He was impotent.",
				"So... he was a smoking cat with a... a metaphorical pipe, that did not work... Are you starting to see the layers here?",
				"This is exciting stuff, you start to get a whole picture here, and it informs the work! It's... it's just remarkable.",
				"J#m D#avis took these raw ideas, these... pieces, and he transformed them into smart social commentary that is...",
				"all so ravishingly beautiful.",
				"I have cried.",
				"I've cried, I've cried... I've cried, cried over this piece. It just... gets in my soul.",

				"I try to explain this to people, I have... the newspaper articles about Ernie Barguckle... ",
				"People have fought me on this, they don't see it, or they're close-minded, How could a comic strip about a cat smoking a",
				"pipe mean any more than that?",

				"But it is more... and when I feel spiritual, or start to think existentially, I still see this comic.",

				"Here's something from 1981 that I wrote in thinking about the implications of this strip; this is just an excerpt here...",
				"there's more before and after, but this part is the essence to me...",
				"If a comic about a cat smoking a pipe can be the only thing in the universe...",
				"then maybe this is the strongest evidence for that.",

				"*fumbles with tattered sheet from 1981*",

				"Many of you say, 'Oh, but I am not blind. I have never been blind,'... ",
				"But when you truly see, you will understand just how truly blind you once were to even",
				"think it right to say you were not blind.",
				"What does a blind man see?",
				"Blackness.",
				"Darkness.",
				"Blankness.",
				"Blank darkness.",
				"Dark blankness.",
				"The absence of things, quite literally NO thing. No things. Nothings.",
				"So, you see nothing, and I bring you into the light. A cat has your pipe! You've been blind,",
				"do you understand this!?",
				"The cat has your pipe.",
				"You can't fully immerse yourself, you don't have the light. You don't have the radiance,",
				"the radical light, the radically radiant light of truth and truth's belonging love, ",
				"and nature of light, and loving truthful radiance.",
				"So don't be bold, and make bold statements. I know of you.",
				"The cat has your pipe.",
				"The.",
				"Cat.",
				"Has.",
				"Your.",
				"Pipe.",
				"Remember that.",
				"*puts paper back in pocket*",
				"That writing, well... It's kind of rough... Kind of an... early eighties feel... and I see that,",
				"but I'm still... I'm still proud of it.",

				"Sometimes I imagine that it is the editorial column in the newspaper Jon Arbuckle is reading. ",
				"It's an exercise in recursion, it's like a vortex opens up... It's like you hold two mirrors up to each other, ",
				"one is reality and the other is a cartoon strip.",

				"Let's see here... Oh yes, I must bring this up, because I think, surely, J#m D#avis is again speaking ",
				"on multiple levels by including the details set before us in the comic.",

				"Notice the glimpse of Jon Arbuckle's foot in the first panel. The size of the shoe would indicate that ",
				"maybe the man just has small feet... but a deeper investigation takes us to the footbinding rituals of ",
				"certain Asian cultures. Inflicted usually on women for the desire of men, this practice was incredibly painful ",
				"and crippling...",

				"Aha! Mister Davis is, here, presenting us with a man, or rather... man, who engages in footbinding,",
				"a body modification for women, on top of being without his pipe... or impotent. This is a man facing ",
				"extreme inner turmoil, the panels tell that story... subconsciously.",

				"Notice the background wall shading of the first panel points inward toward Jon in the second panel...",
				"and the sharp tapered end of the purple pipe in the third frame also points at John in the second panel,",
				"inward; the eye is drawn to the center panel. You can connect these points and draw a triangle across the ",
				"panels, and this triangle will align with the reoriented points of Jon's collar! This, this is majestic artwork!",


				"...and to uncover this hidden order is... bliss like I've never known.",

				"Comforting, in an empty world.",

				"I can't help but read the thought bubble, over and over again.",

				"Now where could my pipe be?",

				"Now where could my pipe be?",

				"It is a profound question.",

				"Why am I here? What is my purpose? It is reflection and self-examination here. It is facing the dust, ",
				"the misery of a cold, careless universe. You can feel the weight of it.",

				"But where could my pipe be?",

				"One imagines the author, J#m D#avis, teetering on the edge of insanity... his rationality, his lucidity,",
				"hovering over the void... and he seeks the truth.",

				"You can see it in the line quality of the drawings; the thoughtful, controlled outlines mixed with the... ",
				"occasional, chaotic scribbles at work in the shadows and Garfield's dark stripes.",

				"It's almost as if Garfield is chaos himself.",

				"Yes, he is the embodiment of chaos, disorder, hatred, fear... Thievery, death, destruction, desolation!",

				"These are the things Garfield represents; HE stole the pipe, HE sits with his back to Jon, Garfield... ",
				"Garfield, this chaos cat, Garfield has turned his back on everything, everyone!",

				"One recalls the great existential forces in literature... Camus' Meursalt, Kafka's Gregor Samsa, ",
				"or Sartre's Antoine Roquentin... Garfield the Cat sees the hopelessness of life, which...ah, yes...",

				"This is why J#m D#avis has chosen smoking. It represents a recklessness, a... ",
				"a disregard for what some would define as the beauty of life. Garfield may die from the nicotine, ",
				"he may not... He defies life; he sits defiant, saying nothing, but looking as if he could say... ",
				"Then let me die... it does not matter.",

				"It does not matter.",

				"...and we are faced with this; Could Jon behave the same? Is Jon the glimmer of hope?",

				"He seems to be unsure. Again, his question... Now where could my pipe be? indicates that he is ",
				"wrestling with his own existence. The center panel centers the issue, and again, this hearkens to many ",
				"of the great religious works of art.",

				"I'm talking about the Pipe Strip in relation to religion. It's... it's interesting to assign the roles of ",
				"God... and anti-God, or, as many know him to be, the devil... or on a much larger scale, simply the forces of...",
				"good and evil. Garfield, the thief-cat, evil and malicious... He is the devil, placed to the right... and note,",
				"the two forms of Jon; the Jon on the left, still innocent, still draped in the... delight, of the lack of knowledge.",
				"He is... the humans in the Garden of Eden. He feels for his pipe... but he has yet to eat from the tree... and Garfield,",
				"the sinister serpent... and notice, notice how J#m D#avis has framed this... The center Jon is locked in a struggle,",
				"between his innocence, and his knowledge of the truth... knowledge of the existence of evil.",

				"It is stunning. The great struggle, the struggle that transcends time... and J#m D#avis floats over all this, as creator...",
				"the God, of sorts, in his own right.",

				"... and he presents this cautionary message to us all; it is as if he is speaking from high and...",
				"he is saying, unto our awaiting ears...",

				"Where will you be, when the cat reveals himself? [-Jim 7:27:78]",

				"I can tell you where you'll be. You will have a choice; you can face endless suffering, and eternal misery...",
				"You can be forced and beaten down with barbarians, who claw at each other just for a view of salvation. ",
				"They'll tear your eyeballs out, and rip your gizzards from end to end. They worship this cat, this... this false",
				"idol! This evil, horrible cat, do not be seduced by the cat and the pipe!",

				"Garfield... thy name is a mark of the demons of hell. Something like this, and to those listening, it is a stark reminder",
				"to follow the path of the first panel Jon; be humble, be grateful, honor the law, and honor thyself. Be true, and be good,",
				"and no harm will come to you... Pray for salvation, and it will be granted unto you. Be like Jon Arbuckle, as he lowers his head.",
				"Be like Jon Arbuckle as he lowers his paper, as he turns his head. Bow with Jon Arbuckle, and praise unto the creator, J#m D#avis...",
				"and banish demon Garfield from your life.",

				"So, what is all this? What am I saying? Aha... hmm... What does all this mean? Why is this one comic strip so important to me...",
				"and why do I feel the need to share this?",

				"Obligation. I have an obligation to you all. This is a redemption, this is a belief in redemption, a sacrifice of all the obvious",
				"trappings of this false modern life.",

				"Look at the simplicity in this strip, in the pipe strip. Look at the simple clothes Jon wears, look at his simple,",
				"basic furniture... No adornments on the wall, even the very pipe his cat Garfield stole; it is a plain, modest pipe...",
				"and I have adapted this way of life, it speaks to me.",

				"In our times... well... you don't need me to point out the hyperbole of our times;",
				"you have children being born eight or nine at a time,",
				"you have more money being spent on a single Hollywood movie than some nations can spend...",
				"feeding their starving people. Torture, distrust... Look around you, it's overwhelming.",

				"What can you contribute?",

				"...and every day, I look in the mirror, and I hold this comic up to the mirror, and I look into the mirror, ",
				"and at this little comic strip.",

				"Be humble.",

				"Be thankful.",

				"It is a reminder, be respectful.",

				"You are a statue. You are fragile... and when you break, when you shatter...",
				"Where will those pieces go?",

				"Ask... ask, ask, ask this question. Will you ask?",

				"Humankind is only as great as you, YOU, the individual, it begins and ends with you! You must treat this expedition,",
				"this search, this... life, with a reverence and intensity found only in the smallest sticks. The littlest leaf,",
				"the tiniest stone! The most miniscule grain of sand... on a beach of billions!",

				"This is the secret.",

				"Do you want the pipe?",

				"Do you want to know where the pipe has gone?",

				"You ask yourself, you ask... you ask... you ask...",

				"Now where could my pipe be?",

				"When I was a young man... remember, now, I first saw this comic when I was eighteen years old... ",
				"Ages ago... but I was youthful, vibrant. For weeks, I didn't hide that a comic strip was having such a profound effect on me.",

				"I was much like Jon Arbuckle. In this middle panel, he says, Now where could my pipe be?...",
				"you could look into his eyes, his half-lowered eyes, and think to yourself... Now, surely, Jon... ",
				"Surely, you cannot be this naive... This is nothing new for you...",

				"And if you've read more of the Garfield comic strips by J#m D#avis, you understand what I am saying now;",
				"Garfield the cat does things like this all the time. He will take things from Jon; food, items, anything...",
				"This is his very nature.",

				"So you see this, and you want to say, Jon Arbuckle, come now. You are lying to yourself.",
				"You are lying to yourself, and to all of us, if you pretend to have not... any idea of where your pipe has gone. ",
				"Perhaps you think you've left it somewhere else, but... hmph, you're not so forgetful. You are lying to yourself, ah...",
				"yes...",

				"You are lying to yourself, Jon Arbuckle. You know that Garfield has the pipe...",
				"somewhere, deep down, you know this. You don't even need to think the question.",

				"And that was me when I saw this strip. One week passed, and each morning I'd open my drawer and slam it shut again.",
				"I would go to look at the comic... but I'd pause, and think... Oh no, I don't need this comic, I don't n... I don't",
				"NEED to look at it...",

				"But there I was, lying to myself.",

				"I DID need to see it, and so I did, it's... cathartic. You give in, and that is the transition,",
				"from the second panel of life, to the third panel of life! It is a simple story structure, the passage ",
				"from the second act to the third, the twilight of things. Jon gives into his suspicions; he knows the truth,",
				"he's ALWAYS known the truth, he yells out, GARFIELD! GARFIELD! GARFIELD!",

				"It is like... pressure from a steam valve, being released; the buildup is unbearable, and then... PSSHHWW, it's gone.",

				"So it is like this... when I speak about the truth... the truth, the light, the radiance, this... ",
				"this is the kind of thing I'm talking about. This is the essence of this brilliant work of art,",
				"the practical mixing, meeting, agreeing with the spiritual, it is all HERE.",

				"...but spirituality is not an easy thing to confront.",
				"You might find yourself able to wrap your mind around a simple math problem,",
				"or a basic newspaper article, or... but intellect... is much less subjective.",

				"What is spirituality... and how have I found spiritual peace and serenity in Garfield?",

				"A long time ago, after I encountered the Pipe Strip... I spent some time, as I mentioned before,",
				"soul-searching. When something impacts you, or alters your very perception so greatly,",
				"there is a long period of confusion, recovery time...",

				"It's as if you don't know who you are, and that can be a... a very scary prospect,",
				"especially if you thought you had a good grasp on that sort of thing.",

				"Imagine if J#m D#avis did not know who he was. Would he be capable of shaping the cultural landscape as he's done?",

				"No. No, of course he wouldn't.",

				"...and how about his characters? Jon... what if J#m D#avis suddenly woke up, and didn't know who Jon was?",
				"What if he couldn't make the informed decisions to accurately depict Garfield's personality, because of...",
				"he could no longer specify, or demarcate the boundaries of Garfield's behavior?",

				"What kind of comic would THAT be? You see?",

				"So draw the parallel. I saw this comic and, yes, I was disoriented... ",
				"and if I didn't reconcile this issue with myself, what kind of person would I be?",

				"Undoubtedly dire circumstances, but remember; this was not a math problem, this was not an article, ",
				"this was not something I could just... figure out... and as skeptical as I was,",
				"I realized that faith and spirituality were avenues that... required exploring.",

				"At first I tried... long nights, reading Garfield by candlelight, or... ",
				"aromatic meditation settings, while thinking of Garfield, but... nothing snapped. ",
				"Nothing clicked, I still felt lost... but I kept it up, I hired a shaman,",
				"and a young... personal Yogi Sikh Guru; Avram Dahb Singh Sahib. I pushed and pushed, ",
				"determined to find myself.",

				"And then, a miracle happened.",

				"Upon retrieving my morning paper, to clip the Garfield comic... I noticed a young girl,",
				"selling lemonade two houses down. She sat, occupied at her stand. She had no customers in sight.",

				"So, I approached, and saw that she was coloring. I looked at her drawing...",

				"Three rectangular boxes.",

				"A man, in a blue shirt. An orange cat.",

				"I knew what this was. Even in her crude scribbles, I knew EXACTLY what this was.",

				"She was drawing a Garfield comic.",

				"I looked at her words, and I saw that, in her strip, Jon asked Garfield to retrieve a newspaper.",
				"Heh, funny... since I'd done just that with myself... Garfield is sarcastic, but agrees to.",
				"He returns and calls Jon... Sahib.",

				"Jon exclaims that the paper's all chewed up, but then Garfield says, and I quote,",
				"Sahib asks fish, paper is wet. Sahib asks cat, paper is holey.",
				"I remember the words, and ran back to my house, and thought,",
				"How odd that Sahib shows up in the strip, and my spiritual advisor's name is Avram Dahb Singh Sahib!",

				"Coincidence surely, but, nonetheless, I spent the next sixteen hours poring through my clipped Garfield comics,",
				"looking for the strip this young girl had been coloring... I couldn't find it... and I eventually fell asleep,",
				"right on my kitchen table.",

				"Next morning, I retrieved my paper again, and I clipped the Garfield comic. The date was July 12th, 1983.",

				"There it was.",

				"The Sahib Strip, in all its glory.",

				"The girl had been drawing the next day's strip!",

				"So, I ran right out of my house, I ran back to where she was... but she was gone,",
				"and in place of the lemonade stand was a For Sale sign.",

				"They'd moved out.",

				"I rushed back to my house to call Avram, but... I was informed that he'd moved away as well.",
				"I reeled, for several hours, and then it all connected for me.",

				"It was meant to be. It w... it was meant to be this way! J#m D#avis... Jon, Garfield...",
				"It was always meant to be this way for me.... They move to the forefront,",
				"and everything else fades away, EVERYTHING else; the girl, the lemonade stand, ",
				"Avram Dahb Singh Sahib, it all existed to show me the way, and when I'd found the way...",

				"Everything else melted away.",

				"It was a beautiful miracle... and if July 27th, 1978, the day I first saw the pipe strip... was the first day of my life, ",
				"then that day, July 12th, 1983, was the second day of my life.",

				"I've never looked back. Garfield has transformed me... and I am a man, born anew, because of Garfield.",

				"When I was in my mid-thirties, I was interviewed for a documentary... It was a documentary on the subject of cat behavior.",
				"Now, I've had cats my whole life; I have three cats now, and at the time of this documentary interview, ",
				"I had four cats. I sat down for the interview and was joined by a veterinarian who specialized in felines:",
				"Doctor Caroline Wellmitz was her name, I believe... and the doctor discussed colorblindness in animals,",
				"and how it affects their behavior.",

				"She specifically brought up the fact that cats are red-green colorblind; they can see colors,",
				"but they can't tell the difference between red and green ...and look at the color choice in this strip here.",

				"Garfield sits on a green floor, behind a pinkish red wall.",

				"I heard this, and I immediately pulled a copy of the comic from my wallet to show to the doctor...",
				"I moved so fast, I'm sure I nearly scared her, I... pointed at the paper and said, Like this! Like this!",
				"Look, at this here! This cat, Garfield, he's colorblind, he must be! That must be the answer here... like this.",

				"As over-excited as I was, I managed to take in her response; she said Yes, a cat in this room would ",
				"have a hard time differentiating the wall from the floor. Add to that a cat's known spatial confusion,",
				"and you have the makings of a Cat Rage room. Now, she informed me that this isn't exactly common knowledge ",
				"among cat owners... but a seasoned cat owner, or someone particularly perceptive will have picked up on it.",

				"So what's incredible here is not only is Garfield's behavior symbolic of the devil, and all the evil constructs ",
				"in the world, but... but, but... but also, it is rooted in science and scientific fact.",

				"Look at that. You cannot spell fact without cat.",

				"Hah, just a little joke there... just some wordplay, but getting back on track...",

				"...and you can't spell track without cat.",

				"Okay... I digress. I gotcha, I gotcha, enough... kidding around.",

				"It is established here that Garfield is in a rage; an ultimate rage of fury and hatred, caused by colorblindness.",
				"We know the what, we know the why... but let us examine the how, the how of his rage is particularly interesting here.",


				"We've looked at his posture and called it powerful, in control, statuesque,",
				"etc., etc. Composed rage... It's peculiar, and I've talked to a number of psychologists and psychiatrists, ",
				"and even a couple of anger management therapists about this concept...",

				"Could we see the same kind of behavior in a human? Is Garfield representative of something more specific ",
				"than just chaos and rage? Deciphering this is going to take some perseverance. for sure.",

				"The psychologists pointed to a phenomenon in humans, and, yes, I believe one of the anger management ",
				"counselors brought it up as well. The idea that people, oftentimes, will bottle their rage... Garfield the cat,",
				"here... well, he could be bottling his anger, inside, shoving it deep into his cat gut, to ignore and deal",
				"with at a later time.",

				"Eh, well... No, that's not exactly right. Garfield has already acted out, he's already stolen the pipe...",
				"he's SMOKING the pipe, he's already dealt with his anger. He's already lashed out, so, psychologically, ",
				"what is going on here? What is this cat doing, and how does it impact his owner, Jon Arbuckle... psychologically?",

				"Well, Garfield is angry. He is acting on his anger... but is this passive anger, or aggressive anger?",

				"Passive. It is passive because if Garfield has a problem with Jon specifically...",
				"he's choosing a passive way of dealing with that problem. He has not confronted Jon, and said,",
				"Jon, I have a problem with the way you've decorated this room;",
				"as a cat, I am colorblind, and this room sends me into a rage...",
				"You've created a rage room for me here, and I don't like it; I want you to change it.",

				"Instead of that confrontational approach, though, Garfield has chosen to steal Jon's pipe...",
				"and that, in turn, angers Jon... but Jon decides to be aggressively angry, and yell at Garfield, so...",
				"now, instead of a calm conversation between two respectful parties, you have two... heated, angry individuals",
				"each with a problem and no direct line to solving it.",

				"The layered emotions here tell a story with tight",
				"focused brevity that would make Hemingway weep. This is an entire drama, in just three panels, people.",

				"...but let's not be remiss, and miss the humor of the situation, the... absurdity of it all... for certainly",
				"there is a reason that the visual shorthand for drama includes both the crying mask AND a laughing mask.",
				"Comedy and tragedy complement each other, and meld together to create drama, tension, the height of humanity",
				"the peak of art, that reflects back to us our own condition...",

				"...and here... in its basest form, we can laugh at this comic... yes, COMIC, in which a cat smokes a pipe...",
				"Hah... when was the last time you've SEEN such a thing in your life?",

				"Never, I presume... I certainly never have...",

				"The Greek muse, Thalia's presence is strong in this work of art, here. Comedy, it is COMEDY...",
				"and if you look at the structure again, you'll see this perfect form of thirds works magically",
				"for the transmission of, yes, YES, a JOKE.",

				"The joke.... is as old as time... even cavemen told jokes,",
				"and the joke here is that Jon has lost his pipe... or he thinks he has...",
				"but lo and behold, it is the cat, Garfield, who has the pipe.",

				"Surprise, surprise, the cat is smoking!",

				"Again, the transition, from set-up to punchline takes place between the second and third panels... but make no mistake",
				"the comic is more than just a comic... Yes, it IS funny, of course it is... it is operating at the height of sophisticated humor",
				"on par with any of Shakespeare's piercing wit.",

				"On the one hand, Garfield the comic, with Jon the man, humor as art...",
				"the other hand, Garfield comic, with Jon the man, stirring... no, RIVETING drama...",
				"as with everything, it is tension, and release. TENSION... and RELEASE...",

				"A cycle.",

				"I keep returning to this idea, because it is so omnipresent. Yes, you could...",
				"and yes, I have done this, on more than one occasion...",
				"you could print this comic strip on a giant piece of paper.",
				"The dimensions would be something like... thirty-four inches by eleven inches.",
				"Now, tape the ends together, with the comic facing inward.",
				"Stick your head in the middle of this Garfield comic loop and READ,",
				"start at the first panel; Jon is reading the newspaper... he feels for something on the end table.",
				"Second panel; he sets the newspaper down, something is not right...",
				"Where could my pipe be? he thinks.",
				"...and then, the payoff; the third panel, Garfield has Jon's pipe, and is smoking it.",
				"But, aha! The paper is in a loop, around your head... so that you can see that, once again, Jon is in his seat,",
				"reading the paper... and so on, and so on, you can literally read the comic strip for an eternity!",
				"I spent many a relaxing Sunday afternoon reading this strip, over and over... reminded of the Portuguese death carvings,",
				"which always begin and end with the same scrawled image.",
				"[fig. 6b - Portuguese Death Carving c. 1330]",
				"So, this idea of repetition, of the beginning being the end, and the end being the beginning...",
				"It's not new, it is an ageless tradition among the best storytellers humanity has ever offered...",
				"and I'm not wrong to include cartoonist J#m D#avis in that exalted set for this particular strip alone",
				"I'm not foolish enough to deny that great art is subjective... divisive, even, and that some people see this Garfield comic",
				"and shrug with no real reaction... but I will say that I believe everyone in the world should see it; at the very least, see it!",
				"You should all see it. Read it. Spend some time with it. Spend an hour reading it... what's an hour?",
				"Yes, you could watch some television program, you could play some fast-paced video games or computer games,",
				"yes, you could do all those things...",
				"But it's just an hour... and if you give this strip a chance, if you look into Jon Arbuckle's eyes...",
				"if you look into Jon Arbuckle's SOUL...",
				"You might find that you'll really be looking into your own soul.",
				"It is self discovery, that is what I'm talking about here... YOU have the opportunity, the possibility...",
				"it could change you. Don't be afraid.",
				"You know, just last week, I was eating lunch near the Municipal Court... like I do every Thursday, and...",
				"there was a plumbing banner... a plumbing van, parked out in front, uh... and a man, a plumber,",
				"would step out from the court, and retrieve something from this every so often.",
				"A few times, this happened... I thought nothing of it; just a plumber, doing some work at the Municipal Court...",
				"but then he came out, and looked through his van, and it was clear...",
				"He couldn't find something.",
				"I noticed, and thought, Well, that's sort of similar to the Garfield comic, in a way. Someone looks for something, ",
				"can't find it,... but, yes, that probably happens billions of times a day around the world...",
				"...but then, this plumber... put his hands on his hips... then, he scratched his head, and he said aloud...",
				"Now, where could my pipe wrench be?",
				"Well, at this, I leaped off the bench, sandwich still in hand, and I rushed over, I shouted, What was that you said!?",
				"He looked at me and said, What? I can't find my pipe wrench,  and I said, No! No, no, say it... like how you just said it...",
				"He scratched his head, and repeated, Now where could my pipe wrench be?",
				"I slapped him on the back and said, Garfield!",
				"He looked so confused, so I said it again... then, I said Your orange cat took it!",
				"Heh... ah, then I laughed and laughed... and he smiled, and went back into the courtroom.",
				"I walked away, knowing that the plumber and I, two complete strangers, bonded over this Garfield comic... You see, ",
				"life imitates art, becomes a common ground.",
				"I have a feeling that if I see this plumber again, we'll be sharing stories like two old friends... because we've been united by art. ",
				"We have a common love for J#m D#avis and his characters, his writings... The humor, the drama, the... that rascal Garfield, the cat...",
				"Oh, and by the way, if you're wondering what I was having for lunch that day, it was a ham sandwich with an apple and potato ",
				"chips... in a bag, I had a soda as well.",
				"I think it's important to view the Pipe Strip in philosophical terms... We've touched briefly on the notion of existentialism; ",
				"that theme is very prevalent in this strip. Garfield is, in fact, a modern existential anti-hero...",
				"but if Garfield embodies the bewilderment in a meaningless life, what is Jon? What are the telltale signs",
				"that inform Jon's philosophical standpoint? His approach, what style of thinking he represents?",
				"Jon is depicted as being grounded in the material world...",
				"a world of things; he is surrounded by objects, and he touches these objects, he interacts with them.",
				"The newspaper, the end table, the chair... his clothes, all these physical things make up Jon's world.",
				"In some sense, even his cat Garfield is an object to him, a thing...",
				"The first ideology that comes to mind when thinking of objects in the tangible world... is pragmatism...",
				"Is Jon Arbuckle a pragmatist? His beliefs stem from a useful, coherent view of his environment...",
				"a sort of cause-and-effect understanding of his world helps him.",
				"A: Deduce that his pipe is missing... and B: Catches his cat, Garfield, using the pipe.",
				"This kind of empirical and logical thinking lends credence to the idea that Jon is, indeed,",
				"a pragmatist... Although, it is hard to entirely ignore the rest of the Garfield comic canon.",
				"While Garfield is consistently anarchic, and embraces the chaos and absurdity of life...",
				"Jon Arbuckle exhibits an erratic, unpredictable mix of philosophical behaviors. At times,",
				"he is borderline; delusional, an idealist, an almost slap-happy version of Don Quixote. Other moments,",
				"he is rigid, nearly to the point of being obsessive... somewhat like a structuralist, and certainly has streaks of sarcasm and ",
				"negativity that might classify him as a skeptic.",
				"...But isn't there some universal truth in this approach? How can any one man, how can Jon Arbuckle be just one thing?",
				"How can any of us be just one thing? We're... an amalgamation of ideas, of emotions... conducts and functions, thoughts and feelings...",
				"Jon Arbuckle may very well inhabit tenets of nearly every major philosophical tract known to man.",
				"We all might.",
				"Characters are reduced, to make them recognizable, definable; a story needs a good guy, a story needs a bad guy...",
				"but rarely is one person defined in such black and white terms. Even Garfield, with all his bad behavior,",
				"Machiavellian motivation and general ne'er-do-well attitude, can be kind and thoughtful.",
				"You just have to find that rare strip.",
				"Speaking philosophically about the entire Garfield franchise, it's an incredibly accurate depiction of life.",
				"Its bold lines and bright colors are merely a facade, a... a red herring, a lie. This cartoon is not a cartoon at all,",
				"it is not a... caricature. It is not caricature despite adopting caricature as its visual style and tone.",
				"...but I don't really like to speak in broad sweeping generalizations about Garfield.",
				"The comic has been running for over thirty years, and to try and boil that all down is just, well... it's impossible.",
				"I think the only way that any historian worth his salt will agree with me is to look at individual moments...",
				"isolated instances, single comic strips.",
				"Can I discuss this one strip in the context of the entire run of Garfield? Yes,",
				"I do that just as a film historian might analyze one movie in relation to the history of all movies,",
				"or a war enthusiast might look at a single battle's impact on an entire war.",
				"The Pipe Strip is just an instance in the lives of Jon and Garfield.",
				"Perhaps Jon is not a pragmatist at all... let's look at this again. Maybe Jon is exhibiting the traits of a rationalist thinker;",
				"his question, Now where could my pipe be? is a clue that his thought process stems",
				"from the early rationalist questions posed by René Descartes. The well-known quote, ",
				"I think, therefore I am, attributed to Descartes, is applicable.",
				"Another close look at the strip, and we see that J#m D#avis chose to draw Jon thinking his question.",
				"Now where could my pipe be?",
				"Jon does not speak this question aloud, so J#m D#avis is also exploring the mind/body duality...",
				"Jon's question operates on the level of a literal question... but it also examines the nature of reality. J#m D#avis' ",
				"epistemological approach tells us something about the human condition; Jon's thoughts remain the focal point of this strip.",
				"The comic is, quite literally, centered around his thought.",
				"Now where could my pipe be?",
				"This is his reality, this is where cognition, and the power and function of the mind take over. As Plato believed,",
				"the body is just a shell for Jon Arbuckle; yes, he can use his physical body to read his paper or cross his legs,",
				"but these inputs of touch, sight, hearing, et cetera, these senses are the triggers of the mind, as we see here,",
				"the mind... is something greater. It is the originator of ideas, and ideas are forever. Immortal.",
				"Immortality through thought, a... a major theme in literature and philosophy...",
				"...and isn't that what Mister J#m D#avis himself has achieved?",
				"Will he live forever?",
				"The universe will continue to spread, and spread outward, and...",
				"entropy will turn a chaotic infinity into a homogenous, controlled system.",
				"This will take billions of years, and in that time, humans will push technology to heights we can't imagine. We'll ",
				"explore and inhabit space, and occupy more and more of the universe, just as time allowed our ancestors to...",
				"multiply in numbers, and populate more and more of the Earth.",
				"...and as the specific people come and go, their physical bodies will be born, and grow, and die... but their thoughts",
				"will remain... and J#m D#avis' comics, his glorious Garfield comics... are recorded ideas of his, that will still be here.",
				"Even when the Earth is no longer inhabitable, and humanity has long since moved away to bigger planets, they'll carry with",
				"them a record, a record we all keep; mark my words... and look at what we've started, what is... What is the internet?",
				"What is the online world, if not a record? Never-ending feed of ideas, immortal ideas... forever placed in the ether of dualism.",
				"What is an idea? Where does it live? How does it manifest itself? Can it live forever? Will it live forever,",
				"outside of these physical husks of ours, our bodies?",
				"...and Jon Arbuckle, and Garfield, started merely as thoughts...",
				"but they've become so much more. That old cliché rings true, they've",
				"taken on a life of their own... and life may not be what we think. ",
				"Life brings to mind a beating heart, breathing lungs, blinking eyes...",
				"...but the real life is in our imaginations... and who better embodies the definition of imagination if not a simple man...",
				"a cartoonist, who puts his ideas to paper so that they may live on, so that our children, and our children's children, and their",
				"children's children's children can access the wealth of ideas that have accumulated thus far...",
				"They will plug themselves into an information grid, and they will have access...",
				"They will read every Garfield comic, 80,000 years from now, a child will see a simple Jon Arbuckle,",
				"reading a newspaper. He will feel around for something, but that something is not there... ",
				"He will lift his head and think...",
				"Now where could my pipe be?",
				"...and Garfield will be smoking the pipe, and Jon will yell GARFIELD!,",
				"...and what then? 80,000 years from now?",
				"The child reading this comic will smile... and that smile will transcend space and time and the physical ",
				"limitations of this existence, whatever they may be, however many dimensions exist...",
				"There will always be Garfield... and there will always be its creator...",

				"Industrial Society and its Future",
				"by	T. Kaczynski",

				"Introduction",
				"1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.",
				"They have greatly increased the",
				"life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries,",
				"but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling,",
				"have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering",
				"(in the Third World to physical",
				"suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.",
				"The continued development of technology will",
				"worsen the situation.",
				"It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities",
				"and inflict greater damage on the natural world,",
				"it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering,",
				"and it may lead to increased physical suffering",
				"even in “advanced” countries.",
				"2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives,",
				"it MAY eventually achieve a low level",
				"of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful",
				"period of adjustment and only at",
				"the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered",
				"products and mere cogs in the",
				"social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There",
				"is no way of reforming or",
				"modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.",
				"3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the",
				"system grows the more disastrous",
				"the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner",
				"rather than later.",
				"4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may",
				"not make use of violence; it",
				"may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict",
				"any of that. But we do",
				"outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take",
				"in order to prepare the way for",
				"a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution.",
				"Its object will be to overthrow not",
				"governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.",
				"5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out",
				"of the industrialtechnological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly",
				"or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we",
				"regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our",
				"discussion to areas that have",
				"received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example,",
				"since there are well-developed",
				"environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental",
				"degradation or the destruction of wild nature,",
				"even though we consider these to be highly important.",

				"The Psychology of Modern Leftism",

				"1. This text was sent in June, 1995, to The New York Times and The Washington Post by the person who calls himself FC,",
				"identified by the FBI as the Unabomber, whom authorities have implicated in three murders and 16 bombings. The author",
				"threatened to send a bomb to an unspecified destination with intent to kill ",
				"unless one of the newspapers published this",
				"manuscript. The Attorney General and the Director of the FBI recommended publication.",
				"This article was published in The",
				"Washington Post, September 19, 1995.",

				"6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society.",
				"One of the most widespread manifestations of the",
				"craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism",
				"can serve as an introduction to the discussion of",
				"the problems of modern society in general.",
				"7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified with socialism.",
				"Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist.",
				"When we speak of leftists in this",
				"article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types, feminists,",
				"gay and disability activists, animal",
				"rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is a leftist.",
				"What we are trying to",
				"get at in discussing leftism is not so much movement or an ideology as a psychological type,",
				"or rather a collection of related",
				"types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism”",
				"will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. (Also,",
				"see paragraphs 227-230.)",
				"8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish,",
				"but there doesn’t seem to be any",
				"remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate",
				"way the two psychological tendencies that",
				"we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism.",
				"We by no means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist",
				"psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to apply to modern leftism only.",
				"We leave open the question of the extent to which",
				"our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
				"9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.”",
				"Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole,",
				"while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain",
				"segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.",

				"Feelings of Inferiority",
				"10. By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense",
				"but a whole spectrum of related traits;",
				"low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt,",
				"self-hatred, etc. We argue that modern",
				"leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings",
				"are decisive in determining the",
				"direction of modern leftism.",
				"11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups",
				"with whom he identifies)",
				"we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among",
				"minority rights activists,",
				"whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive",
				"about the words used to",
				"designate minorities and about anything that is said concerning minorities.",
				"The terms “Negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped” or",
				"“chick” for an African, an Asian,",
				"a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick”",
				"were merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.”",
				"The negative connotations have been attached to these",
				"terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject the word",
				"“pet” and insist on its",
				"replacement by “animal companion.” Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything ",
				"about primitive",
				"peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the word “primitive” by ",
				"“nonliterate.” They",
				"may seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to ours.",
				"(We do not mean to",
				"imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hyper sensitivity",
				"of leftish anthropologists.)",
				"12. Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect” terminology are not",
				"the average black ghetto-dweller, Asian",
				"immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do",
				"not even belong to any",
				"“oppressed” group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its",
				"stronghold among university",
				"professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries,",
				"and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males",
				"from middle- to upper-middle-class families.",
				"13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have",
				"an image of being weak (women),",
				"defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior.",
				"The leftists themselves feel that these groups are",
				"inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely ",
				"because they do see these",
				"groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women,",
				"    Indians, etc. ARE inferior;",
				"we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)",
				"14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men.",
				"Clearly they are nagged by a",
				"fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.",

				"15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful.",
				"They hate America, they hate",
				"Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality.",
				"The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly",
				"do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, ",
				"    imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric",
				"and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures,",
				"the leftist finds excuses for them,",
				"or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out ",
				"(and often greatly",
				"exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these",
				"faults are not the leftist’s real",
				"motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong",
				"and successful.",
				"16. Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” “optimism,” ",
				"etc., play little role in the liberal and",
				"leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society",
				"to solve every one’s problems for them,",
				"satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has",
				"an inner sense of confidence in his",
				"ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to",
				"the concept of competition because,",
				"deep inside, he feels like a loser.",
				"17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, ",
				"defeat and despair, or else they take an",
				"orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing",
				"anything through rational calculation and",
				"all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.",
				"18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to",
				"insist that everything is culturally",
				"relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific",
				"knowledge and about how, if at all, the",
				"concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish philosophers",
				"are not simply cool-headed",
				"logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved ",
				"emotionally in their attack on truth",
				"and reality. They attack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one ",
				"thing, their attack is an outlet for",
				"hostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More",
				"importantly, the leftist hates science and",
				"rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and ",
				"other beliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior).",
				"The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate any classification",
				"of some things as successful or superior",
				"and other things as failed or inferior. This also underlies the rejection by many leftists ",
				"of the concept of mental illness and of",
				"the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities ",
				"or behavior because such explanations",
				"tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society",
				"the credit or blame for an",
				"individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is “inferior” it is not his fault,",
				"but society’s, because he has not been brought",
				"up properly.",
				"19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart,",
				"an egotist, a bully, a selfpromoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith ",
				"in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power",
				"and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity to be strong, ",
				"and his efforts to make himself strong",
				"produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that.",
				"His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he",
				"cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist.",
				"He can feel strong only as",
				"a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.",
				"20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics.",
				"Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally",
				"provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective,",
				"but many leftists use them not as a means to",
				"an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist trait.",
				"21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, ",
				"and moral principle does play a",
				"role for the leftist of the oversocialized type.",
				"But compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist",
				"activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior;",
				"so is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior",
				"is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. ",
				"For example, if one",
				"believes that affirmative action is good for black people,",
				"does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or",
				"dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic",
				"and conciliatory approach that would make at",
				"least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action",
				"discriminates against them. But leftist",
				"activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. ",
				"    Helping black people is not their real",
				"goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and ",
				"frustrated need for power. In doing",
				"so they actually harm black people, because the activists’ hostile attitude toward the white",
				"majority tends to intensify race",
				"hatred.",
				"22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems",
				"in order to provide themselves",
				"with an excuse for making a fuss.",

				"23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone",
				"who might be considered a",
				"leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.",
				"Oversocialization",
				"24. Psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the process by which children are",
				"trained to think and act as society",
				"demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of",
				"his society and fits in well as a",
				"functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are",
				"over-socialized, since the leftist is",
				"perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended.",
				"Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.",
				"25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think,",
				"feel and act in a completely moral way. For example,",
				"we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other,",
				"whether he admits it to himself",
				"or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think,",
				"feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In",
				"order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves",
				"about their own motives and find moral",
				"explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a nonmoral origin",
				". We use the term “oversocialized” to describe such",
				"people. [2]",
				"26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, ",
				"defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important",
				"means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed ",
				"of behavior or speech that is contrary to",
				"society’s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially",
				"susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling",
				"ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person ",
				"are more restricted by society’s",
				"expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people",
				"engage in a significant amount of naughty",
				"behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws,",
				"they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful",
				"things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy.",
				"The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if",
				"he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred.",
				"    The oversocialized person cannot even experience,",
				"without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality;",
				"he cannot think “unclean” thoughts. And",
				"socialization is not just a matter of morality;",
				"we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the",
				"heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash",
				"and spends his life running on rails that",
				"society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense",
				"of constraint and powerlessness that can be",
				"a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious",
				"cruelties that human being inflict on one",
				"another.",
				"27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is",
				"oversocialized and that their oversocialization",
				"is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists",
				"of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals",
				"or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals",
				"[3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of",
				"our society and also the most leftwing segment.",
				"28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash",
				"and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But",
				"usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society.",
				"Generally speaking, the goals of today’s",
				"leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality.",
				"On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as",
				"its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle.",
				"    Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes,",
				"helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence generally,",
				"freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More",
				"fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society",
				"to take care of the individual. All these have",
				"been deeply rooted values of our society ",
				"(or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These values are",
				"explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material",
				"presented to us by the mainstream communications",
				"media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type,",
				"usually do not rebel against these",
				"principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming (with some degree of truth)",
				"that society is not living up to these",
				"principles.",
				"29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment",
				"to the conventional attitudes",
				"of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people",
				"into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools;",
				"the way of life of the black",
				"“underclass” they regard as a social disgrace.",
				"They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business",
				"executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class white people.",
				"The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is",
				"to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead,",
				"they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does",
				"this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, ",

				"listening to black-style music,",
				"wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque.",
				"In other words, it can",
				"express itself only in superficial matters.",
				"In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the",
				"black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects,",
				"become an executive or a",
				"scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white.",
				"They want to make black",
				"fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc.",
				"But these are exactly the values of the industrialtechnological system.",
				"The system couldn’t care less what kind of music a man listens to,",
				"what kind of clothes he wears or what",
				"religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job,",
				"climbs the status ladder, is a “responsible”",
				"parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the",
				"black man into the system and make him adopt its values.",
				"30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type,",
				"NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our",
				"society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel ",
				"against one of modern society’s",
				"most important principles by engaging in physical violence.",
				"By their own account, violence is for them a form of “liberation.”",
				"In other words, by committing violence they break through the psychological restraints ",
				"that have been trained into them.",
				"Because they are oversocialized these restraints have been more confining for them than ",
				"for others; hence their need to break",
				"free of them. But they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values.",
				"If they engage in violence they claim to be",
				"fighting against racism or the like.",
				"31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology",
				"The real situation is complex,",
				"and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes even if the necessary data were",
				"available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies",
				"in the psychology of modern leftism.",
				"32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole.",
				"Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies",
				"and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in the left,",
				"they are widespread in our society.",
				"And today’s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous society.",
				"We are even told by experts how to eat,",
				"how to exercise, how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.",

				"The Power Process",
				"33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the ",
				"“power process.” This is closely",
				"related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. ",
				"The power process has four",
				"elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. ",
				"(Everyone needs to have goals whose",
				"attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.)",
				"The fourth element is more difficult to",
				"define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later",
				"(paragraphs 42-44).",
				"34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it.",
				"Such a man has power, but",
				"he will develop serious psychological problems.",
				"At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored",
				"and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured ",
				"aristocracies tend to become",
				"decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their",
				"power. But leisured, secure",
				"aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and ",
				"demoralized, even though they have",
				"power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise",
				"one’s power.",
				"35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life:",
				"    food, water and whatever clothing and shelter",
				"are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without",
				"effort. Hence his boredom and",
				"demoralization.",
				"36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities,",
				"and in frustration if nonattainment of",
				"the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results",
				"in defeatism, low self-esteem or",
				"depression.",
				"37. Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems,",
				"a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and",
				"he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.",

				"Surrogate Activities",
				"38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized.",
				"For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of sinking",
				"into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology,",
				"a field in which he became distinguished. When people do not",
				"have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often",
				"set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then",
				"pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise",
				"would have put into the search for",
				"physical necessities. Thus the aristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary ",
				"pretensions; many European aristocrats a few",
				"centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting,",
				"though they certainly didn’t need the meat; other aristocracies",
				"have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth;",
				"and a few aristocrats, like Hirohito, have turned to science.",
				"39. We use the term “surrogate activity”",
				"to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for",
				"themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say,",
				"merely for the sake of the “fulfillment” that they",
				"get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities.",
				"Given a person who devotes",
				"much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this:",
				"If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying",
				"his biological needs,",
				"and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties",
				"in a varied and interesting way,",
				"would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X?",
				"If the answer is no, then the person’s pursuit of goal X is a",
				"surrogate activity. Hirohito’s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity,",
				"since it is pretty certain that if",
				"Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks",
				"in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would",
				"not have felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy and",
				"life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the",
				"pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity,",
				"because most people, even if their existence were otherwise",
				"satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without",
				"ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite",
				"sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really",
				"    needs, can be a surrogate activity.)",
				"40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to",
				"satisfy one’s physical needs. It is enough to go through a",
				"training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to",
				"    work on time and exert the very modest effort needed to",
				"hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of intelligence",
				"and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has",
				"those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes, there is",
				"    an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for",
				"granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus it is",
				"not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate",
				"activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement,",
				"humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the",
				"corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond",
				"the point at which they cease to give any additional",
				"physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues",
				"that are not important for the activist personally, as in the",
				"case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite minorities.",
				"These are not always PURE surrogate activities, since",
				"for many people they may be motivated in part by needs other than the",
				"need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may",
				"be motivated in part by a drive for prestige, artistic creation by a",
				"need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility.",
				"But for most people who pursue them, these activities are in large",
				"part surrogate activities. For example, the majority of",
				"scientists will probably agree that the “fulfillment” they get ",
				"from their work is more important than the money and prestige",
				"they earn.",
				"41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less ",
				"satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, goals that people",
				"would want to attain even if their need for the power process were",
				"already fulfilled). One indication of this is the fact that, in",
				"many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate ",
				"activities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the moneymaker constantly strives for more and more wealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next.",
				"The long-distance runner drives himself to run always farther and ",
				"faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say",
				"that they get far more fulfillment from these activities than they",
				"do from the “mundane” business of satisfying their biological",
				"needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to ",
				"satisfy the biological needs has been reduced to triviality. More",
				"importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological",
				"    needs AUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an",
				"immense social machine. In contrast, people generally have a great",
				"deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities.",
				"Autonomy",
				"42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for ",
				"every individual. But most people need a greater or",
				"lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. Their efforts ",
				"must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be",
				"under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to ",
				"    exert this initiative, direction and control as single",
				"individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group. ",
				"Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among",
				"themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their ",
				"need for the power process will be served. But if they",
				"work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room ",
				"for autonomous decision and initiative, then their",
				"    ",
				"    need for the power process will not be served. The same is true when ",
				"    decisions are made on a collective basis if the group",
				"making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual ",
				"is insignificant. [5]",
				"43. It is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. ",
				"Either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it",
				"by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. ",
				"And then there are unthinking, animal types",
				"who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power (the good combat",
				"soldier, who gets his sense of power by",
				"developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in",
				"blind obedience to his superiors).",
				"44. But for most people it is through the power process having ",
				"a goal, making an AUTONOMOUS effort and attaining the goal",
				"-- that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are ",
				"acquired. When one does not have adequate opportunity to go",
				"through the power process the consequences are (depending on the ",
				"    individual and on the way the power process is disrupted)",
				"boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, ",
				"defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility,",
				"spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior,",

				"Sources of Social Problems",
				"45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in ",
				"modern industrial society they are present on a massive",
				"scale. We aren’t the first to mention that the world today seems to be ",
				"going crazy. This sort of thing is not normal for human",
				"societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered",
				"from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied",
				"with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all was",
				"sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women",
				"was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly ",
				"common among some of the American Indian tribes.",
				"But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that ",
				"we have listed in the preceding paragraph were",
				"far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.",
				"46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society",
				"to the fact that that society requires people to live",
				"under conditions radically different from those under which the human race",
				"evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with",
				"the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under",
				"the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have",
				"already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience",
				"the power process as the most important of the",
				"abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not",
				"the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the",
				"power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the",
				"other sources.",
				"47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are",
				"excessive density of population, isolation of man",
				"from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural ",
				"small-scale communities such as the extended",
				"family, the village or the tribe.",
				"48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression.",
				"The degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation",
				"of man from nature are consequences of technological progress.",
				"All pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. The",
				"Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and",
				"the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern",
				"agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to ",
				"support a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also,",
				"technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts",
				"increased disruptive powers in people’s hands. For example, a",
				"variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles,",
				"etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people",
				"who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is",
				"restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the",
				"regulations. But if these machines had never been invented there would",
				"have been no conflict and no frustration generated by",
				"them.)",
				"49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly)",
				"provided a stable framework and therefore a",
				"sense of security. In the modern world it is human society",
				"that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern",
				"society changes very rapidly owing to technological change.",
				"Thus there is no stable framework.",
				"50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values,",
				"yet they enthusiastically support",
				"technological progress and economic growth.",
				"Apparently it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in",
				"the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes",
				"in all other aspects of the society as well, and that",
				"such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.",
				"51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown",
				"of the bonds that hold together traditional smallscale social groups. ",
				"The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact",
				"that modern conditions often",

				"require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves",
				"from their communities. Beyond that, a",
				"technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities ",
				"if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an",
				"individual’s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily ",
				"to a smallscale community, because if the internal loyalties",
				"of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system,",
				"such communities would pursue their own advantage at",
				"the expense of the system.",
				"52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin,",
				"his friend or his co-religionist to a position",
				"rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job.",
				"He has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the",
				"system, and that is “nepotism” or “discrimination,” both of which are terrible sins in modern society.",
				"Would-be industrial",
				"societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties ",
				"to loyalty to the system are usually very",
				"inefficient. (Look at Latin America.) Thus an advanced industrial society",
				"can tolerate only those small-scale communities that",
				"are emasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. [7]",
				"53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been ",
				"widely recognized as sources of social problems.",
				"But we do not believe they are enough to account for the extent of the",
				"problems that are seen today.",
				"54. A few pre-industrial cities were very large and crowded, yet their ",
				"inhabitants do not seem to have suffered from",
				"psychological problems to the same extent as modern man. In America today ",
				"there still are uncrowded rural areas, and we find",
				"there the same problems as in urban areas, though the problems tend to be ",
				"less acute in the rural areas. Thus crowding does not",
				"seem to be the decisive factor.",
				"55. On the growing edge of the American frontier during the 19th century,",
				"the mobility of the population probably broke down",
				"extended families and small-scale social groups to at least the same extent",
				"as these are broken down today. In fact, many",
				"nuclear families lived by choice in such isolation, having no neighbors within",
				"several miles, that they belonged to no",
				"community at all, yet they do not seem to have developed problems as a result.",
				"56. Furthermore, change in American frontier society was",
				"very rapid and deep. A man might be born and raised in a log cabin,",
				"outside the reach of law and order and fed largely on wild meat;",
				"and by the time he arrived at old age he might be working at a",
				"regular job and living in an ordered community with effective law enforcement.",
				"This was a deeper change than that which",
				"typically occurs in the life of a modern individual,",
				"yet it does not seem to have led to psychological problems. In fact, 19th",
				"century American society had an optimistic and self-confident tone,",
				"quite unlike that of today’s society. [8]",
				"57. The difference, we argue, is that modern man has the sense ",
				"(largely justified) that change is IMPOSED on him, whereas the",
				"19th century frontiersman had the sense (also largely justified)",
				"that he created change himself, by his own choice. Thus a",
				"pioneer settled on a piece of land of his own choosing and made ",
				"it into a farm through his own effort. In those days an entire",
				"county might have only a couple of hundred inhabitants and was a ",
				"far more isolated and autonomous entity than a modern",
				"county is. Hence the pioneer farmer participated as a member of a ",
				"relatively small group in the creation of a new, ordered",
				"community. One may well question whether the creation of this community ",
				"was an improvement, but at any rate it satisfied the",
				"pioneer’s need for the power process.",
				"58. It would be possible to give other examples of societies in ",
				"which there has been rapid change and/or lack of close",
				"community ties without the kind of massive behavioral aberration ",
				"that is seen in today’s industrial society. We contend that the",
				"most important cause of social and psychological problems in modern",
				"society is the fact that people have insufficient",
				"opportunity to go through the power process in a normal way. We don’t",
				"mean to say that modern society is the only one in",
				"which the power process has been disrupted. Probably most",
				"if not all civilized societies have interfered with the power process",
				"to a greater or lesser extent. But in modern industrial society",
				"the problem has become particularly acute. Leftism, at least in its",
				"recent (mid- to late-20th century) form,",
				"is in part a symptom of deprivation with respect to the power process.",
				"Disruption of the Power Process in Modern Society",
				"59. We divide human drives into three groups:",
				"(1) those drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort;",
				"(2) those that can be",
				"satisfied but only at the cost of serious effort;",
				"(3) those that cannot be adequately satisfied no matter how much effort one",
				"makes. The power process is the process of satisfying the drives of the second group.",
				"The more drives there are in the third",
				"group, the more there is frustration, anger, eventually defeatism, depression, etc.",

				"60. In modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the first",
				"and third groups, and the second group",
				"tends to consist increasingly of artificially created drives.",
				"61. In primitive societies, physical necessities generally fall into group ",
				"2: They can be obtained, but only at the cost of serious",
				"effort. But modern society tends to guaranty the physical necessities to everyone ",
				"[9] in exchange for only minimal effort, hence",
				"physical needs are pushed into group ",
				"1. (There may be disagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job is",
				"“minimal”; but usually, ",
				"in lower- to middle-level jobs, ",
				"whatever effort is required is merely that of OBEDIENCE. You sit or",
				"stand where you are told to sit or stand and do what you are told to ",
				"    do in the way you are told to do it. Seldom do you have to",
				"exert yourself seriously, and in any case you have hardly any autonomy ",
				"in work, so that the need for the power process is not",
				"well served.)",
				"62. Social needs, such as sex, love and status, often remain in group ",
				"2 in modern society, depending on the situation of the",
				"individual. [10] But, except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status,",
				"the effort required to fulfill the social",
				"drives is insufficient to satisfy adequately the need for the power process.",
				"63. So certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group ",
				"2, hence serve the need for the power process. Advertising",
				"and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel",
				"they need things that their grandparents never",
				"desired or even dreamed of. It requires serious effort to earn enough",
				"money to satisfy these artificial needs, hence they fall into",
				"group 2. (But see paragraphs 80-82.) Modern man must satisfy his need",
				"for the power process largely through pursuit of the",
				"artificial needs created by the advertising and marketing industry ",
				"[11], and through surrogate activities.",
				"64. It seems that for many people, maybe the majority,",
				"these artificial forms of the power process are insufficient. A theme that",
				"appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the ",
				"20th century is the sense of purposelessness that",
				"afflicts many people in modern society.",
				"(This purposelessness is often called by other names such as “anomie” ",
				"    or “middleclass vacuity.”) We suggest that the so-called “identity crisis” ",
				"is actually a search for a sense of purpose, often for commitment",
				"to a suitable surrogate activity. It may be that existentialism is in large part a response",
				"to the purposelessness of modern life.",
				"[12] Very widespread in modern society is the search for “fulfillment.”",
				"But we think that for the majority of people an activity",
				"whose main goal is fulfillment (that is, a surrogate activity)",
				"does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment. In other words,",
				"it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process. (See paragraph 41.)",
				"That need can be fully satisfied only through",
				"activities that have some external goal, such as physical necessities, sex, love, status, revenge, etc.",
				"65. Moreover, where goals are pursued through earning money, climbing the status ladder",
				"or functioning as part of the system",
				"in some other way, most people are not in a position to pursue their goals AUTONOMOUSLY.",
				"Most workers are someone",
				"else’s employee and,",
				"as we pointed out in paragraph 61, must spend their days doing what they are told to do in the way they",
				"are told to do it. Even people who are in business for themselves have only limited autonomy.",
				"It is a chronic complaint of",
				"small-business persons and entrepreneurs that their hands",
				"are tied by excessive government regulation. Some of these",
				"regulations are doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part",
				"government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of our",
				"extremely complex society. A large portion of small business",
				"today operates on the franchise system. It was reported in the",
				"Wall Street Journal a few years ago that many of the ",
				"franchise-granting companies require applicants for franchises to take a",
				"personality test that is designed to EXCLUDE those who",
				"have creativity and initiative, because such persons are not",
				"sufficiently docile to go along obediently with the franchise system.",
				"This excludes from small business many of the people who",
				"most need autonomy.",
				"66. Today people live more by virtue of what the system does FOR them ",
				"or TO them than by virtue of what they do for",
				"themselves. And what they do for themselves is done more and more along",
				"    channels laid down by the system. Opportunities",
				"tend to be those that the system provides, the opportunities must be ",
				"exploited in accord with rules and regulations [13], and",
				"techniques prescribed by experts must be followed if there is to be a ",
				"chance of success.",
				"67. Thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a",
				"deficiency of real goals and a deficiency of autonomy in the",
				"pursuit of goals. But it is also disrupted because of those human",
				"drives that fall into group 3: the drives that one cannot",
				"adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one makes. One of",
				"these drives is the need for security. Our lives depend on",
				"decisions made by other people; we have no control over these ",
				"decisions and usually we do not even know the people who",
				"make them. (“We live in a world in which relatively few people",
				"    -- maybe 500 or 1,000 make the important decisions” -- Philip",
				"B. Heymann of Harvard Law School, quoted by Anthony Lewis,",
				"New York Times, April 21,1995.) Our lives depend on",
				"whether safety standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained;",
				"on how much pesticide is allowed to get into our",
				"food or how much pollution into our air; on how skillful (or incompetent) ",
				"our doctor is; whether we lose or get a job may",
				"depend on decisions made by government economists or corporation executives;",
				"and so forth. Most individuals are not in a",
				"position to secure themselves against these threats to more [than] a very",
				"limited extent. The individual’s search for security is",
				"therefore frustrated, which leads to a sense of powerlessness.",

				"68. It may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern man,",
				"as is shown by his shorter life expectancy;",
				"hence modern man suffers from less, not more than the amount of insecurity that is normal for human beings. But",
				"psychological security does not closely correspond with physical security.",
				"What makes us FEEL secure is not so much",
				"objective security as a sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves.",
				"Primitive man, threatened by a fierce animal",
				"or by hunger, can fight in self-defense or travel in search of food.",
				"He has no certainty of success in these efforts, but he is by no",
				"means helpless against the things that threaten him. The modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things",
				"against which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food,",
				"environmental pollution, war, increasing taxes, invasion of",
				"his privacy by large organizations,",
				"nationwide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his way of life.",
				"69. It is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that threaten him;",
				"disease for example. But he can",
				"accept the risk of disease stoically. It is part of the nature of things,",
				"it is no one’s fault, unless it is the fault of some imaginary,",
				"impersonal demon. But threats to the modern individual tend to be MAN-MADE.",
				"They are not the results of chance but are",
				"IMPOSED on him by other persons whose decisions he, as an individual, is unable to influence.",
				"Consequently he feels",
				"frustrated, humiliated and angry.",
				"70. Thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands ",
				"(either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL",
				"group) whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or",
				"organizations that are too remote or too large for him",
				"to be able personally to influence them. So modern man’s drive for security",
				"tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some areas",
				"(food, shelter etc.) his security is assured at the cost of only trivial effort,",
				"whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security.",
				"(The foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough,",
				"general way how the condition of modern",
				"man differs from that of primitive man.)",
				"71. People have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessarily frustrated in modern life,",
				"hence fall into group 3. One",
				"may become angry, but modern society cannot permit fighting.",
				"In many situations it does not even permit verbal aggression.",
				"When going somewhere one may be in a hurry, or one may be in a mood to travel slowly, ",
				"but one generally has no choice but",
				"to move with the flow of traffic and obey the traffic signals.",
				"One may want to do one’s work in a different way, but usually one",
				"can work only according to the rules laid down by one’s employer. ",
				"In many other ways as well, modern man is strapped down",
				"by a network of rules and regulations (explicit or implicit)",
				"that frustrate many of his impulses and thus interfere with the power",
				"process. Most of these regulations cannot be dispensed with, ",
				"because they are necessary for the functioning of industrial",
				"society.",
				"72. Modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive.",
				"In matters that are irrelevant to the functioning of the system",
				"we can generally do what we please. We can believe in any religion ",
				"(as long as it does not encourage behavior that is",
				"dangerous to the system). We can go to bed with anyone we like ",
				"(as long as we practice “safe sex”). We can do anything we",
				"like as long as it is UNIMPORTANT. But in all IMPORTANT matters the system tends increasingly",
				"to regulate our behavior.",
				"73. Behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the government.",
				"Control is often exercised through",
				"indirect coercion or through psychological pressure or manipulation, ",
				"and by organizations other than the government, or by the",
				"system as a whole. Most large organizations use some form of propaganda ",
				"[14] to manipulate public attitudes or behavior.",
				"Propaganda is not limited to “commercials” and advertisements,",
				"and sometimes it is not even consciously intended as",
				"propaganda by the people who make it. For instance,",
				"the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of",
				"propaganda. An example of indirect coercion: ",
				"There is no law that says we have to go to work every day and follow our",
				"employer’s orders. Legally there is nothing to prevent us from going to live in ",
				"the wild like primitive people or from going into",
				"business for ourselves. But in practice there is very little wild country left,",
				"and there is room in the economy for only a limited",
				"number of small business owners.",
				"Hence most of us can survive only as someone else’s employee.",
				"74. We suggest that modern man’s obsession with longevity,",
				"and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual attractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom",
				"of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to the power process. The “mid-life",
				"crisis” also is such a symptom. So is the lack of interest in having children that is fairly common",
				"in modern society but almost",
				"unheard-of in primitive societies.",
				"75. In primitive societies life is a succession of stages.",
				"The needs and purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no",
				"particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage.",
				"A young man goes through the power process by becoming a hunter,",
				"hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is necessary for food.",
				"(In young women the process is more",
				"complex, with greater emphasis on social power; we won’t discuss that here.)",
				"This phase having been successfully passed",
				"through, the young man has no reluctance about settling down to the responsibilities",
				"of raising a family. (In contrast, some",
				"modern people indefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy",
				"seeking some kind of “fulfillment.” We suggest",
				"that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process",
				"-- with real goals instead of the artificial goals of ",

				"surrogate activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, ",
				"going through the power process by providing them with",
				"the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is done ",
				"and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that",
				"long) and death. any modern people, on the other hand, are disturbed by ",
				"the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is",
				"shown by the amount of effort they expend trying to maintain their physical",
				"condition, appearance and health. We argue that",
				"this is due to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never",
				"put their physical powers to any practical use, have",
				"never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way.",
				"It is not the primitive man, who has used his body",
				"daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the",
				"modern man, who has never had a practical use for his",
				"body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose need",
				"for the power process has been satisfied during his",
				"life who is best prepared to accept the end of that life.",
				"76. In response to the arguments of this section someone will say,",
				"“Society must find a way to give people the opportunity to",
				"go through the power process.” For such people the value of the",
				"opportunity is destroyed by the very fact that society gives it to",
				"them. What they need is to find or make their own opportunities.",
				"As long as the system GIVES them their opportunities it still",
				"has them on a leash. To attain autonomy they must get off that leash.",
				"How Some People Adjust",
				"77. Not everyone in industrial-technological society suffers from psychological problems.",
				"Some people even profess to be",
				"quite satisfied with society as it is. We now discuss some of the reasons why people",
				"differ so greatly in their response to",
				"modern society.",
				"78. First, there doubtless are differences in the strength of the drive for power.",
				"Individuals with a weak drive for power may",
				"have relatively little need to go through the power process,",
				"or at least relatively little need for autonomy in the power process.",
				"These are docile types who would have been happy as plantation darkies in the Old South.",
				"(We don’t mean to sneer at the",
				"“plantation darkies” of the Old South.",
				"To their credit, most of the slaves were NOT content with their servitude. We do sneer at",
				"people who ARE content with servitude.)",
				"79. Some people may have some exceptional drive,",
				"in pursuing which they satisfy their need for the power process. For",
				"example, those who have an unusually strong drive",
				"for social status may spend their whole lives climbing the status ladder",
				"without ever getting bored with that game.",
				"80. People vary in their susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques.",
				"Some are so susceptible that, even if they make",
				"a great deal of money, they cannot satisfy their constant craving for",
				"the shiny new toys that the marketing industry dangles",
				"before their eyes. So they always feel hard-pressed financially even if their income is large,",
				"and their cravings are frustrated.",
				"81. Some people have low susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques.",
				"These are the people who aren’t interested in",
				"money. Material acquisition does not serve their need for the power process.",
				"82. People who have medium susceptibility to advertising and ",
				"marketing techniques are able to earn enough money to satisfy",
				"their craving for goods and services, but only at the cost of serious ",
				"effort (putting in overtime, taking a second job, earning",
				"promotions, etc.). Thus material acquisition serves their need for the",
				"power process. But it does not necessarily follow that their",
				"need is fully satisfied. They may have insufficient autonomy in the power",
				"process (their work may consist of following orders)",
				"and some of their drives may be frustrated (e.g., security, aggression). ",
				"(We are guilty of oversimplification in paragraphs 80-82",
				"because we have assumed that the desire for material acquisition is entirely",
				"a creation of the advertising and marketing",
				"industry. Of course it’s not that simple. [11]",
				"83. Some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves",
				"with a powerful organization or mass movement.",
				"An individual lacking goals or power joins a movement or an organization,",
				"adopts its goals as his own, then works toward",
				"those goals. When some of the goals are attained, the individual,",
				"even though his personal efforts have played only an",
				"insignificant part in the attainment of the goals, feels (through his identification",
				"with the movement or organization) as if he",
				"had gone through the power process. This phenomenon was exploited by the fascists, naizs and communists.",
				"Our society uses it",
				"too, though less crudely. Example: Manuel Noriega was an irritant to the U.S. (goal: punish Noriega). The U.S. invaded",
				"Panama (effort) and punished Noriega (attainment of goal). Thus the U.S. went through the power process and many",
				"Americans, because of their identification with the U.S., experienced the power process",
				"vicariously. Hence the widespread",
				"public approval of the Panama invasion; it gave people a sense of power.",
				"[15] We see the same phenomenon in armies,",
				"corporations, political parties, humanitarian organizations,",
				"religious or ideological movements. In particular, leftist movements",

				"tend to attract people who are seeking to satisfy their need for power.",
				"But for most people identification with a large",
				"organization or a mass movement does not fully satisfy the need for power.",
				"84. Another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is through surrogate activities.",
				"As we explained in",
				"paragraphs 38-40, a surrogate activity is an activity that is directed toward ",
				"an artificial goal that the individual pursues for the",
				"sake of the “fulfillment” that he gets from pursuing the goal,",
				"not because he needs to attain the goal itself. For instance, there is",
				"no practical motive for building enormous muscles,",
				"hitting a little ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage",
				"stamps. Yet many people in our society devote themselves with passion to bodybuilding,",
				"golf or stamp-collecting. Some people",
				"are more “other-directed” than others,",
				"and therefore will more readily attach importance to a surrogate activity simply because",
				"the people around them treat it as important or because society tells them it is important.",
				"That is why some people get very",
				"serious about essentially trivial activities such as sports, or bridge,",
				"or chess, or arcane scholarly pursuits, whereas others who",
				"are more clear-sighted never see these things as anything but the surrogate activities that they are,",
				"and consequently never",
				"attach enough importance to them to satisfy their need for the power process in that way.",
				"It only remains to point out that in",
				"many cases a person’s way of earning a living is also a surrogate activity.",
				"Not a PURE surrogate activity, since part of the",
				"motive for the activity is to gain the physical necessities and (for some people) ",
				"social status and the luxuries that advertising",
				"makes them want. But many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary to earn whatever money and status",
				"they require, and this extra effort constitutes a surrogate activity. This extra effort,",
				"together with the emotional investment that",
				"accompanies it, is one of the most potent forces acting toward the continual development",
				"and perfecting of the system, with",
				"negative consequences for individual freedom (see paragraph 131). Especially,",
				"for the most creative scientists and engineers,",
				"work tends to be largely a surrogate activity.",
				"This point is so important that it deserves a separate discussion, which we shall",
				"give in a moment (paragraphs 87-92).",
				"85. In this section we have explained how many people in modern society do satisfy their ",
				"    need for the power process to a",
				"greater or lesser extent. But we think that for the majority of people the need for ",
				"the power process is not fully satisfied. In the",
				"first place, those who have an insatiable drive for status, or who get firmly “hooked”",
				"on a surrogate activity, or who identify",
				"strongly enough with a movement or organization to satisfy their need for power in that way,",
				"are exceptional personalities.",
				"Others are not fully satisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an organization ",
				"(see paragraphs 41, 64). In the",
				"second place, too much control is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through socialization, which results in a",
				"deficiency of autonomy,",
				"and in frustration due to the impossibility of attaining certain goals",
				"and the necessity of restraining too",
				"many impulses.",
				"86. But even if most people in industrial-technological society were well satisfied,",
				"we (FC) would still be opposed to that form",
				"of society, because (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one’s",
				"need for the power process through",
				"surrogate activities or through identification with an organization,",
				"rather than through pursuit of real goals.",
				"The Motives of Scientists",
				"87. Science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities.",
				"Some scientists claim that they are",
				"motivated by “curiosity” or by a desire to “benefit humanity.” ",
				"But it is easy to see that neither of these can be the principal",
				"motive of most scientists. As for “curiosity,” that notion is simply absurd.",
				"Most scientists work on highly specialized problems",
				"that are not the object of any normal curiosity. For example, is an astronomer,",
				"a mathematician or an entomologist curious",
				"about the properties of isopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not.",
				"Only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is",
				"curious about it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. ",
				"Is the chemist curious about the appropriate classification of a",
				"new species of beetle? No. That question is of interest only to the entomologist,",
				"and he is interested in it only because",
				"entomology is his surrogate activity. If the chemist and the entomologist",
				"had to exert themselves seriously to obtain the",
				"physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their ",
				"abilities in an interesting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they",
				"wouldn’t give a damn about isopropyltrimethylmethane or the",
				"classification of beetles. Suppose that lack of funds for",
				"postgraduate education had led the chemist to become an insurance",
				"broker instead of a chemist. In that case he would have",
				"been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared ",
				"nothing about isopropyltrimethylmethane. In any case it is not",
				"normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the amount ",
				"of time and effort that scientists put into their work. The",
				"“curiosity” explanation for the scientists’ motive just doesn’t ",
				"stand up.",
				"88. The “benefit of humanity” explanation doesn’t work any better.",
				"Some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the",
				"welfare of the human race most of archaeology or comparative linguistics ",
				"for example. Some other areas of science present",
				"obviously dangerous possibilities. Yet scientists in these areas are ",
				"just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop",
				"vaccines or study air pollution. Consider the case of Dr. Edward Teller,",
				"who had an obvious emotional involvement in",

				"promoting nuclear power plants. Did this involvement stem from a desire",
				"to benefit humanity? If so, then why didn’t Dr. Teller",
				"get emotional about other “humanitarian” causes? If he was such a",
				"humanitarian then why did he help to develop the H-bomb?",
				"As with many other scientific achievements, it is very much open to",
				"question whether nuclear power plants actually do benefit",
				"humanity. Does the cheap electricity outweigh the accumulating waste",
				"and the risk of accidents? Dr. Teller saw only one side",
				"of the question. Clearly his emotional involvement with nuclear power",
				"arose not from a desire to “benefit humanity” but from a",
				"personal fulfillment he got from his work and from seeing it put to",
				"practical use.",
				"89. The same is true of scientists generally. With possible rare",
				"exceptions, their motive is neither curiosity nor a desire to",
				"benefit humanity but the need to go through the power process: to ",
				"have a goal (a scientific problem to solve), to make an effort",
				"(research) and to attain the goal (solution of the problem.) Science",
				"is a surrogate activity because scientists work mainly for the",
				"fulfillment they get out of the work itself.",
				"90. Of course, it’s not that simple. Other motives do play a role ",
				"    for many scientists. Money and status for example. Some",
				"scientists may be persons of the type who have an insatiable drive",
				"for status (see paragraph 79) and this may provide much of",
				"the motivation for their work. No doubt the majority of scientists,",
				"like the majority of the general population, are more or less",
				"susceptible to advertising and marketing techniques and need money",
				"to satisfy their craving for goods and services. Thus",
				"science is not a PURE surrogate activity. But it is in large part ",
				"a surrogate activity.",
				"91. Also, science and technology constitute a power mass movement,",
				"and many scientists gratify their need for power through",
				"identification with this mass movement (see paragraph 83).",
				"92. Thus science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare",
				"of the human race or to any other standard, obedient",
				"only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government",
				"officials and corporation executives who provide the",
				"funds for research",

				"The Nature of Freedom",
				"93. We are going to argue that industrial-technological society cannot",
				"be reformed in such a way as to prevent it from",
				"progressively narrowing the sphere of human freedom. But, because “freedom”",
				"is a word that can be interpreted in many ways,",
				"we must first make clear what kind of freedom we are concerned with.",
				"94. By “freedom” we mean the opportunity to go through the power process,",
				"with real goals not the artificial goals of surrogate",
				"activities, and without interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone,",
				"especially from any large organization. Freedom",
				"means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group)",
				"of the life-and-death issues of one’s",
				"existence; food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one’s ",
				"environment. Freedom means",
				"having power; not the power to control other people but the power",
				"to control the circumstances of one’s own life. One does not",
				"have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization)",
				"has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and",
				"permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72).",
				"95. It is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed rights. But these are",
				"not as important as they seem. The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and",
				"technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government.",
				"[16] Most of the Indian nations of New",
				"England were monarchies, and many of the cities of the Italian",
				"Renaissance were controlled by dictators. But in reading about",
				"these societies one gets the impression that they allowed far",
				"more personal freedom than our society does. In part this was",
				"because they lacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler’s",
				"will: There were no modern, well-organized police forces,",
				"no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras,",
				"no dossiers of information about the lives of average citizens.",
				"Hence it was relatively easy to evade control.",
				"96. As for our constitutional rights, consider for example that",
				"of freedom of the press. We certainly don’t mean to knock that",
				"right; it is very important tool for limiting concentration of",
				"political power and for keeping those who do have political power",
				"in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part.",
				"But freedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen",
				"as an individual. The mass media are mostly under the control",
				"of large organizations that are integrated into the system.",
				"Anyone who has a little money can have something printed, ",
				"or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what",
				"he has to say will be swamped by the vast volume of material",
				"put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. To",
				"make an impression on society with words is therefore almost ",
				"impossible for most individuals and small groups. Take us (FC)",
				"for example. If we had never done anything violent and had ",
				"submitted the present writings to a publisher, they probably would",

				"not have been accepted. If they had been accepted and published,",
				"they probably would not have attracted many readers,",
				"because it’s more fun to watch the entertainment put out by the",
				"media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had",
				"many readers, most of these readers would soon have forgotten",
				"what they had read as their minds were flooded by the mass of",
				"material to which the media expose them. In order to get our ",
				"message before the public with some chance of making a lasting",
				"impression, we’ve had to kill people.",
				"97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they ",
				"do not serve to guarantee much more than what might be called the",
				"bourgeois conception of freedom. According to the bourgeois ",
				"conception, a “free” man is essentially an element of a social",
				"machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited ",
				"freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the",
				"social machine more than those of the individual. Thus the",
				"bourgeois’s “free” man has economic freedom because that",
				"promotes growth and progress; he has freedom of the press",
				"because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders;",
				"he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at ",
				"the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. This was clearly",
				"the attitude of Simon Bolivar. To him, people deserved ",
				"liberty only if they used it to promote progress (progress as conceived",
				"by the bourgeois). Other bourgeois thinkers have taken a ",
				"similar view of freedom as a mere means to collective ends. Chester",
				"C. Tan, “Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth ",
				"Century,” page 202, explains the philosophy of the Kuomintang leader Hu",
				"Han-min: “An individual is granted rights because he ",
				"is a member of society and his community life requires such rights. By",
				"community Hu meant the whole society of the nation.” ",
				"And on page 259 Tan states that according to Carsum Chang (Chang",
				"Chun-mai, head of the State Socialist Party in China)",
				"freedom had to be used in the interest of the state ",
				"and of the people as a",
				"whole. But what kind of freedom does one have if one ",
				"can use it only as someone else prescribes? FC’s conception of freedom",
				"is not that of Bolivar, Hu, Chang or other bourgeois ",
				"theorists. The trouble with such theorists is that they have made the",
				"development and application of social theories their ",
				"surrogate activity. Consequently the theories are designed to serve the",
				"needs of the theorists more than the needs of any ",
				"people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the theories",
				"are imposed.",
				"98. One more point to be made in this section: It should",
				"not be assumed that a person has enough freedom just because he",
				"SAYS he has enough. Freedom is restricted in part by ",
				"psychological controls of which people are unconscious, and moreover",
				"many people’s ideas of what constitutes freedom are",
				"governed more by social convention than by their real needs. For",
				"example, it’s likely that many leftists of the oversocialized",
				"type would say that most people, including themselves, are",
				"socialized too little rather than too much, yet the oversocialized",
				"leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of",
				"socialization.",
				"Some Principles of History",
				"99. Think of history as being the sum of two components:",
				"an erratic component that consists of unpredictable events that",
				"follow no discernible pattern, and a regular component that",
				"consists of long-term historical trends. Here we are concerned with",
				"the long-term trends.",
				"100. FIRST PRINCIPLE. If a SMALL change is made that affects a",
				"long-term historical trend, then the effect of that change",
				"will almost always be transitory -- the trend will soon revert ",
				"to its original state. (Example: A reform movement designed to",
				"clean up political corruption in a society rarely has more than ",
				"a short-term effect; sooner or later the reformers relax and",
				"corruption creeps back in. The level of political corruption in ",
				"a given society tends to remain constant, or to change only slowly",
				"with the evolution of the society. Normally, a political cleanup",
				"will be permanent only if accompanied by widespread social",
				"changes; a SMALL change in the society won’t be enough.) If a",
				"small change in a long-term historical trend appears to be",
				"permanent, it is only because the change acts in the direction",
				"in which the trend is already moving, so that the trend is not",
				"altered by only pushed a step ahead.",
				"101. The first principle is almost a tautology. If a trend were not stable with ",
				"respect to small changes, it would wander at",
				"random rather than following a definite direction; in other words it would not ",
				"be a long-term trend at all.",
				"102. SECOND PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter",
				"permanently a long-term historical trend, then",
				"it will alter the society as a whole. In other words, a society is a system",
				"in which all parts are interrelated, and you can’t",
				"permanently change any important part without changing all other parts as well.",
				"103. THIRD PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is large enough to alter",
				"permanently a long-term trend, then the",
				"consequences for the society as a whole cannot be predicted in advance.",
				"(Unless various other societies have passed through",
				"the same change and have all experienced the same consequences,",
				"in which case one can predict on empirical grounds that",
				"another society that passes through the same change will be like to",
				"experience similar consequences.)",
				"104. FOURTH PRINCIPLE. A new kind of society cannot be designed on paper.",
				"That is, you cannot plan out a new form of",
				"society in advance, then set it up and expect it to function as it was",
				"designed to do.",
				"105. The third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human",
				"societies. A change in human behavior will affect the",
				"economy of a society and its physical environment; the economy will",
				"affect the environment and vice versa, and the changes in",
				"the economy and the environment will affect human behavior in complex,",
				"unpredictable ways; and so forth. The network of",
				"causes and effects is far too complex to be untangled and understood.",
				"106. FIFTH PRINCIPLE. People do not consciously and rationally choose",
				"the form of their society. Societies develop through",
				"processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control.",
				"107. The fifth principle is a consequence of the other four.",
				"108. To illustrate: By the first principle, generally speaking an ",
				"attempt at social reform either acts in the direction in which the",
				"society is developing anyway (so that it merely accelerates a change",
				"that would have occurred in any case) or else it has only a",
				"transitory effect, so that the society soon slips back into its old groove.",
				"To make a lasting change in the direction of",
				"development of any important aspect of a society, reform is insufficient",
				"and revolution is required. (A revolution does not",
				"necessarily involve an armed uprising or the overthrow of a government.)",
				"By the second principle, a revolution never changes",
				"only one aspect of a society, it changes the whole society;",
				"and by the third principle changes occur that were never expected or",
				"desired by the revolutionaries. By the fourth principle, when revolutionaries",
				"or utopians set up a new kind of society, it never",
				"works out as planned.",
				"109. The American Revolution does not provide a counterexample.",
				"The American “Revolution” was not a revolution in our",
				"sense of the word, but a war of independence followed by a rather",
				"far-reaching political reform. The Founding Fathers did not",
				"change the direction of development of American society, nor did",
				"they aspire to do so. They only freed the development of",
				"American society from the retarding effect of British rule. Their political",
				"reform did not change any basic trend, but only",
				"pushed American political culture along its natural direction of development.",
				"British society, of which American society was",
				"an offshoot, had been moving for a long time in the direction of ",
				"representative democracy. And prior to the War of",
				"Independence the Americans were already practicing a significant",
				"degree of representative democracy in the colonial",
				"assemblies. The political system established by the Constitution",
				"was modeled on the British system and on the colonial",
				"assemblies. With major alteration, to be sure --",
				"there is no doubt that the Founding Fathers took a very important step. But it",
				"was a step along the road that English-speaking world was already traveling.",
				"The proof is that Britain and all of its colonies",
				"that were populated predominantly by people of British descent ended up with",
				"systems of representative democracy essentially",
				"similar to that of the United States. If the Founding Fathers had lost their",
				"nerve and declined to sign the Declaration of",
				"Independence, our way of life today would not have been significantly different.",
				"Maybe we would have had somewhat closer",
				"ties to Britain, and would have had a Parliament and Prime Minister",
				"instead of a Congress and President. No big deal. Thus the",
				"American Revolution provides not a counterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them.",
				"110. Still, one has to use common sense in applying the principles.",
				"They are expressed in imprecise language that allows",
				"latitude for interpretation, and exceptions to them can be found.",
				"So we present these principles not as inviolable laws but as",
				"rules of thumb, or guides to thinking, that may provide a partial",
				"antidote to naive ideas about the future of society. The",
				"principles should be borne constantly in mind, and whenever one reaches a conclusion ",
				"that conflicts with them one should",
				"carefully reexamine one’s thinking and retain the conclusion only",
				"if one has good, solid reasons for doing so.",
				"Industrial-Technological Society Cannot Be Reformed",
				"111. The foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult",
				"it would be to reform the industrial system in such a way",
				"as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom.",
				"There has been a consistent tendency, going back at least",
				"to the Industrial Revolution for technology to strengthen the system ",
				"at a high cost in individual freedom and local autonomy.",
				"Hence any change designed to protect freedom from technology would be",
				"contrary to a fundamental trend in the development",
				"of our society. Consequently, such a change either would be a transitory one ",
				"-- soon swamped by the tide of history -- or, if",
				"large enough to be permanent would alter the nature of our whole society.",
				"This by the first and second principles. Moreover,",
				"since society would be altered in a way that could not be predicted ",
				"in advance (third principle) there would be great risk.",

				"Changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of ",
				"freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that",
				"they would gravely disrupt the system. So any attempts at reform",
				"would be too timid to be effective. Even if changes large",
				"enough to make a lasting difference were initiated, they would be",
				"retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent.",
				"Thus, permanent changes in favor of freedom could be brought about",
				"only by persons prepared to accept radical, dangerous",
				"and unpredictable alteration of the entire system. In other words",
				"by revolutionaries, not reformers.",
				"112. People anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed",
				"benefits of technology will suggest naive schemes for",
				"some new form of society that would reconcile freedom with technology.",
				"Apart from the fact that people who make such",
				"suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the new form of",
				"society could be set up in the first place, it follows",
				"from the fourth principle that even if the new form of society could be ",
				"once established, it either would collapse or would give",
				"results very different from those expected.",
				"113. So even on very general grounds it seems highly improbable that",
				"any way of changing society could be found that would",
				"reconcile freedom with modern technology. In the next few sections we",
				"will give more specific reasons for concluding that",
				"freedom and technological progress are incompatible.",
				"Restriction of Freedom is Unavoidable in Industrial Society",
				"114. As explained in paragraphs 65-67, 70-73, modern man is strapped",
				"down by a network of rules and regulations, and his",
				"fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose decisions",
				"he cannot influence. This is not accidental or a result",
				"of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. It is necessary and ",
				"inevitable in any technologically advanced society. The system",
				"HAS TO regulate human behavior closely in order to function. At work",
				"    people have to do what they are told to do, otherwise",
				"production would be thrown into chaos. Bureaucracies HAVE TO be run",
				"according to rigid rules. To allow any substantial",
				"personal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats would disrupt the",
				"system and lead to charges of unfairness due to differences in",
				"the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion. It is ",
				"true that some restrictions on our freedom could be eliminated,",
				"but GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of our lives by large ",
				"organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrialtechnological society. The result is a sense of powerlessness on the part of the average person. It may be, however, that formal",
				"regulations will tend increasingly to be replaced by psychological",
				"tools that make us want to do what the system requires of us.",
				"(Propaganda [14], educational techniques, “mental health” programs,",
				"    etc.)",
				"115. The system HAS TO force people to behave in ways that are ",
				"increasingly remote from the natural pattern of human",
				"behavior. For example, the system needs scientists, mathematicians ",
				"and engineers. It can’t function without them. So heavy",
				"pressure is put on children to excel in these fields. It isn’t natural",
				"for an adolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time",
				"sitting at a desk absorbed in study. A normal adolescent wants to spend",
				"his time in active contact with the real world. Among",
				"primitive peoples the things that children are trained to do tend to be",
				"    in reasonable harmony with natural human impulses.",
				"Among the American Indians, for example, boys were trained in active",
				"outdoor pursuits -- just the sort of thing that boys like.",
				"But in our society children are pushed into studying technical subjects,",
				"which most do grudgingly.",
				"[[116 not used.]]",
				"117. In any technologically advanced society the individual’s fate MUST",
				"depend on decisions that he personally cannot",
				"influence to any great extent. A technological society cannot be broken",
				"down into small, autonomous communities, because",
				"production depends on the cooperation of very large numbers of people.",
				"When a decision affects, say, a million people, then",
				"each of the affected individuals has, on the average, only a one-millionth share",
				"in making the decision. What usually happens",
				"in practice is that decisions are made by public officials or corporation ",
				"executives, or by technical specialists, but even when",
				"the public votes on a decision the number of voters ordinarily is too large",
				"for the vote of any one individual to be significant.",
				"[17] Thus most individuals are unable to influence measurably the major",
				"decisions that affect their lives. There is no",
				"conceivable way to remedy this in a technologically advanced society.",
				"The system tries to “solve” this problem by using",
				"propaganda to make people WANT the decisions that have been made for ",
				"them, but even if this “solution” were completely",
				"successful in making people feel better, it would be demeaning.",
				"118. Conservatives and some others advocate more “local autonomy.”",
				"Local communities once did have autonomy, but such",
				"autonomy becomes less and less possible as local communities become",
				"more enmeshed with and dependent on large-scale",
				"systems like public utilities, computer networks, highway systems, ",
				"the mass communications media, the modern health care",
				"system. Also operating against autonomy is the fact that technology ",
				"applied in one location often affects people at other",

				"locations far way. Thus pesticide or chemical use near a creek may ",
				"contaminate the water supply hundreds of miles",
				"downstream, and the greenhouse effect affects the whole world.",
				"119. The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. ",
				"Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit",
				"the needs of the system. This has nothing to do with the political",
				"or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological",
				"system. It is the fault of technology, because the system is guided",
				"not by ideology but by technical necessity. [18] Of course the",
				"system does satisfy many human needs, but generally speaking it ",
				"does this only to the extend that it is to the advantage of the",
				"system to do it. It is the needs of the system that are paramount,",
				"not those of the human being. For example, the system",
				"provides people with food because the system couldn’t function if everyone starved; ",
				"    it attends to people’s psychological needs",
				"whenever it can CONVENIENTLY do so, because it couldn’t function if",
				"    too many people became depressed or rebellious. But",
				"the system, for good, solid, practical reasons, must exert constant ",
				"pressure on people to mold their behavior to the needs of the",
				"system. To much waste accumulating? The government, the media,",
				"the educational system, environmentalists, everyone",
				"inundates us with a mass of propaganda about recycling. Need more ",
				"technical personnel? A chorus of voices exhorts kids to",
				"study science. No one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force",
				"adolescents to spend the bulk of their time studying subjects",
				"most of them hate. When skilled workers are put out of a job by ",
				"technical advances and have to undergo “retraining,” no one",
				"asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed around in this way.",
				"It is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow",
				"to technical necessity. and for good reason: If human needs were put",
				"before technical necessity there would be economic",
				"problems, unemployment, shortages or worse. The concept of “mental health” ",
				"in our society is defined largely by the extent to",
				"which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does ",
				"so without showing signs of stress.",
				"120. Efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within",
				"the system are no better than a joke. For example,",
				"one company, instead of having each of its employees assemble only one ",
				"section of a catalogue, had each assemble a whole",
				"catalogue, and this was supposed to give them a sense of purpose and achievement.",
				"Some companies have tried to give their",
				"employees more autonomy in their work, but for practical reasons this usually can",
				"be done only to a very limited extent, and in",
				"any case employees are never given autonomy as to ultimate goals -- ",
				"their “autonomous” efforts can never be directed toward",
				"goals that they select personally, but only toward their employer’s goals, ",
				"such as the survival and growth of the company. Any",
				"company would soon go out of business if it permitted its employees to act otherwise.",
				"Similarly, in any enterprise within a",
				"socialist system, workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of the enterprise,",
				"otherwise the enterprise will not serve its",
				"purpose as part of the system. Once again, for purely technical reasons it is not possible",
				"for most individuals or small groups to",
				"have much autonomy in industrial society. Even the small-business owner commonly has only",
				"limited autonomy. Apart from",
				"the necessity of government regulation, he is restricted by the fact that he must fit",
				"into the economic system and conform to its",
				"requirements. For instance, when someone develops a new technology, ",
				"the small- business person often has to use that",
				"technology whether he wants to or not, in order to remain competitive.",
				"The ‘Bad’ Parts of Technology Cannot Be Separated from the ‘Good’ Parts",
				"121. A further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor ",
				"of freedom is that modern technology is a unified",
				"system in which all parts are dependent on one another. You can’t get ",
				"rid of the “bad” parts of technology and retain only the",
				"“good” parts. Take modern medicine, for example. Progress in medical",
				"science depends on progress in chemistry, physics,",
				"biology, computer science and other fields. Advanced medical treatments",
				"require expensive, high-tech equipment that can be",
				"made available only by a technologically progressive, economically",
				"rich society. Clearly you can’t have much Progress in",
				"medicine without the whole technological system and everything that ",
				"goes with it.",
				"122. Even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest",
				"of the technological system, it would by itself bring certain",
				"evils. Suppose for example that a cure for diabetes is discovered.",
				"People with a genetic tendency to diabetes will then be able to",
				"survive and reproduce as well as anyone else. Natural selection",
				"against genes for diabetes will cease and such genes will spread",
				"throughout the population. (This may be occurring to some extent",
				"already, since diabetes, while not curable, can be controlled",
				"through use of insulin.) The same thing will happen with many",
				"other diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic",
				"degradation of the population. The only solution will be some",
				"sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic engineering of",
				"human beings, so that man in the future will no longer be a ",
				"creation of nature, or of chance, or of God (depending on your",
				"religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product.",
				"123. If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW,",
				"just wait till the government starts regulating the",
				"genetic constitution of your children. Such regulation will inevitably ",
				"follow the introduction of genetic engineering of human",
				"beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous. [19]",

				"124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about “medical ethics.”",
				"But a code of ethics would not serve to protect",
				"freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse.",
				"A code of ethics applicable to genetic engineering",
				"would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of human beings.",
				"Somebody (probably the upper-middle class,",
				"mostly) would decide that such and such applications of genetic engineering were ",
				"“ethical”. and others were not, so that in",
				"effect they would be imposing their own values on the genetic constitution",
				"of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics",
				"were chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their",
				"own values on any minorities who might",
				"have a different idea of what constituted an “ethical” ",
				"use of genetic engineering. The only code of ethics that would truly",
				"protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering of human beings,",
				"and you can be sure that no such",
				"code will ever be applied in a technological society.",
				"No code that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up",
				"for long, because the temptation presented by the immense power of biotechnology",
				"would be irresistible, especially since to the",
				"majority of people many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally",
				"good (eliminating physical and mental",
				"diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today’s world).",
				"Inevitably, genetic engineering will be used",
				"extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the ",
				"industrial-technological system. [20]",
				"Technology is a More Powerful Social Force than the Aspiration for Freedom",
				"125. It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and freedom,",
				"because technology is by far the",
				"more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises.",
				"Imagine the case of",
				"two neighbors, each of whom at the outset owns the same amount of land,",
				"but one of whom is more powerful than the other.",
				"The powerful one demands a piece of the other’s land. The weak one refuses.",
				"The powerful one says, “OK, let’s compromise.",
				"Give me half of what I asked.” The weak one has little choice but to give in.",
				"Some time later the powerful neighbor demands",
				"another piece of land, again there is a compromise,",
				"and so forth. By forcing a long series of compromises on the weaker man,",
				"the powerful one eventually gets all of his land. ",
				"So it goes in the conflict between technology and freedom.",
				"126. Let us explain why technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom.",
				"127. A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom",
				"often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. For",
				"example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased,",
				"go at his own pace without",
				"observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support-systems.",
				"When motor vehicles were",
				"introduced they appeared to increase man’s freedom.",
				"They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an",
				"automobile if he didn’t want one,",
				"and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a",
				"walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society",
				"in such a way as to restrict greatly man’s",
				"freedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, ",
				"it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car,",
				"especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one’s",
				"own pace one’s movement is governed by the",
				"flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations:",
				"license requirements, driver test, renewing",
				"registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, ",
				"monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized",
				"transport is no longer optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport",
				"the arrangement of our cities has changed in such",
				"a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance ",
				"of their place of employment, shopping areas and",
				"recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile",
				"for transportation. Or else they must use public",
				"transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own",
				"movement than when driving a car. Even the walker’s",
				"freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop",
				"to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to",
				"serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and ",
				"unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this",
				"important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized ",
				"transport: When a new item of technology is introduced",
				"as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does",
				"not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the",
				"new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find",
				"themselves FORCED to use it.)",
				"128. While technological progress AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere",
				"of freedom, each new technical advance",
				"CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be desirable. Electricity, indoor plumbing,",
				"rapid long-distance communications ... how",
				"could one argue against any of these things, or against any other",
				"of the innumerable technical advances that have made modern",
				"society? It would have been absurd to resist the introduction of the telephone,",
				"for example. It offered many advantages and no",
				"disadvantages. Yet, as we explained in paragraphs 59-76,",
				"all these technical advances taken together have created a world in",
				"which the average man’s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors",
				"and friends, but in those of",
				"politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians",
				"and bureaucrats whom he as an individual has no power",
				"to influence. [21] The same process will continue in the future. ",
				"Take genetic engineering, for example. Few people will resist",
				"the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a hereditary disease.",
				"It does no apparent harm and prevents much",

				"suffering. Yet a large number of genetic improvements taken together will ",
				"make the human being into an engineered product",
				"rather than a free creation of chance (or of God, or whatever,",
				"depending on your religious beliefs).",
				"129. Another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that,",
				"within the context of a given society, technological",
				"progress marches in only one direction; it can never be reversed.",
				"Once a technical innovation has been introduced, people",
				"usually become dependent on it, so that they can never again do without it,",
				"unless it is replaced by some still more advanced",
				"innovation. Not only do people become dependent as individuals on a new item of technology,",
				"but, even more, the system as a",
				"whole becomes dependent on it. (Imagine what would happen to the system today if computers,",
				"for example, were eliminated.)",
				"Thus the system can move in only one direction, toward greater technologization.",
				"Technology repeatedly forces freedom to",
				"take a step back, but technology can never take a step back ",
				"-- short of the overthrow of the whole technological system.",
				"130. Technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many different points",
				"at the same time (crowding, rules",
				"and regulations, increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations,",
				"propaganda and other psychological techniques,",
				"genetic engineering, invasion of privacy through surveillance devices",
				"and computers, etc.). To hold back any ONE of the",
				"threats to freedom would require a long and difficult social struggle.",
				"Those who want to protect freedom are overwhelmed by",
				"the sheer number of new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop,",
				"hence they become apathetic and no longer resist.",
				"To fight each of the threats separately would be futile.",
				"Success can be hoped for only by fighting the technological system as a",
				"whole; but that is revolution, not reform.",
				"131. Technicians (we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who",
				"perform a specialized task that requires training)",
				"tend to be so involved in their work (their surrogate activity)",
				"that when a conflict arises between their technical work and",
				"freedom, they almost always decide in favor of their technical work.",
				"This is obvious in the case of scientists, but it also appears",
				"elsewhere: Educators humanitarian groups, conservation organizations",
				"do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological",
				"techniques to help them achieve their laudable ends. Corporations and ",
				"government agencies, when they find it useful, do not",
				"hesitate to collect information about individuals without regard to their privacy.",
				"Law enforcement agencies are frequently",
				"inconvenienced by the constitutional rights of suspects and often of completely innocent persons,",
				"and they do whatever they",
				"can do legally (or sometimes illegally)",
				"    to restrict or circumvent those rights. Most of these educators, government officials and",
				"law officers believe in freedom, privacy and constitutional rights,",
				"but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that",
				"their work is more important.",
				"132. It is well known that people generally work better and more persistently",
				"when striving for a reward than when attempting",
				"to avoid a punishment or negative outcome.",
				"Scientists and other technicians are motivated mainly by the rewards they get",
				"through their work. But those who oppose technological invasions of freedom",
				"are working to avoid a negative outcome,",
				"consequently there are few who work persistently and well at this",
				"discouraging task. If reformers ever achieved a signal victory",
				"that seemed to set up a solid barrier against further erosion of ",
				"freedom through technical progress, most would tend to relax and",
				"turn their attention to more agreeable pursuits. But the scientists",
				"would remain busy in their laboratories, and technology as it",
				"progresses would find ways, in spite of any barriers, to exert more",
				"and more control over individuals and make them always",
				"more dependent on the system.",
				"133. No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ",
				"ethical codes, can provide permanent protection against",
				"technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory;",
				"they all change or break down eventually. But",
				"technological advances are permanent within the context of a given ",
				"civilization. Suppose for example that it were possible to",
				"arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic engineering",
				"from being applied to human beings, or prevent it",
				"from being applied in such a way as to threaten freedom and dignity.",
				"Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or",
				"later the social arrangement would break down. Probably sooner,",
				"given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic",
				"engineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom. and this invasion",
				"would be irreversible (short of a breakdown of",
				"technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything",
				"permanent through social arrangements should be",
				"dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation.",
				"A few years ago its seemed that there were secure",
				"legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms of environmental degradation.",
				"A change in the political wind, and",
				"those barriers begin to crumble.",
				"134. For all of the foregoing reasons, technology is a more powerful social force",
				"than the aspiration for freedom. But this",
				"statement requires an important qualification. It appears that during",
				"the next several decades the industrial-technological",
				"system will be undergoing severe stresses due to economic and ",
				"environmental problems, and especially due to problems of",
				"human behavior (alienation, rebellion, hostility, a variety of ",
				"social and psychological difficulties). We hope that the stresses",
				"through which the system is likely to pass will cause it to break down,",
				"or at least will weaken it sufficiently so that a revolution",
				"against it becomes possible. If such a revolution occurs and is successful,",
				"then at that particular moment the aspiration for",
				"freedom will have proved more powerful than technology.",

				"135. In paragraph 125 we used an analogy of a weak neighbor who is left destitute",
				"by a strong neighbor who takes all his land",
				"by forcing on him a series of compromises. But suppose now that the strong neighbor",
				"gets sick, so that he is unable to defend",
				"himself. The weak neighbor can force the strong one to give him his land back,",
				"or he can kill him. If he lets the strong man",
				"survive and only forces him to give the land back,",
				"he is a fool, because when the strong man gets well he will again take all the",
				"land for himself. The only sensible alternative for the weaker man is to kill the",
				"strong one while he has the chance. In the same",
				"way, while the industrial system is sick we must destroy it.",
				"If we compromise with it and let it recover from its sickness, it will",
				"eventually wipe out all of our freedom.",
				"Simpler Social Problems Have Proved Intractable",
				"136. If anyone still imagines that it would be possible to reform the system ",
				"in such a way as to protect freedom from",
				"technology, let him consider how clumsily and for the most part unsuccessfully",
				"our society has dealt with other social problems",
				"that are far more simple and straightforward. Among other things, the system ",
				"has failed to stop environmental degradation,",
				"political corruption, drug trafficking or domestic abuse.",
				"137. Take our environmental problems, for example. Here the conflict",
				"of values is straightforward: economic expedience now",
				"versus saving some of our natural resources for our grandchildren.",
				"[22] But on this subject we get only a lot of blather and",
				"obfuscation from the people who have power, and nothing like a clear,",
				"consistent line of action, and we keep on piling up",
				"environmental problems that our grandchildren will have to live with.",
				"Attempts to resolve the environmental issue consist of",
				"struggles and compromises between different factions,",
				"some of which are ascendant at one moment, others at another moment.",
				"The line of struggle changes with the shifting currents of public opinion.",
				"This is not a rational process, nor is it one that is",
				"likely to lead to a timely and successful solution to the problem.",
				"Major social problems, if they get “solved” at all, are rarely or",
				"never solved through any rational, comprehensive plan.",
				"They just work themselves out through a process in which various",
				"competing groups pursuing their own (usually short-term) ",
				"self-interest [23] arrive (mainly by luck) at some more or less stable",
				"modus vivendi. In fact, the principles we formulated in paragraphs",
				"100-106 make it seem doubtful that rational long-term",
				"social planning can EVER be successful.",
				"138. Thus it is clear that the human race has at best a very limited ",
				"capacity for solving even relatively straightforward social",
				"problems. How then is it going to solve the far more ",
				"difficult and subtle problem of reconciling freedom with technology?",
				"Technology presents clear-cut material advantages, whereas freedom is ",
				"an abstraction that means different things to different",
				"people. and its loss is easily obscured by propaganda and fancy talk.",
				"139. And note this important difference: It is conceivable that our ",
				"environmental problems (for example) may some day be",
				"settled through a rational, comprehensive plan, but if this happens ",
				"it will be only because it is in the long-term interest of the",
				"system to solve these problems. But it is NOT in the interest of the system",
				"to preserve freedom or small-group autonomy. On",
				"the contrary, it is in the interest of the system to bring human behavior under",
				"control to the greatest possible extent. [24] Thus,",
				"while practical considerations may eventually force the system to take a rational,",
				"prudent approach to environmental problems,",
				"equally practical considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior",
				"ever more closely (preferably by indirect",
				"means that will disguise the encroachment on freedom). This isn’t just our opinion.",
				"Eminent social scientists (e.g. James Q.",
				"Wilson) have stressed the importance of “socializing” people more effectively.",
				"Revolution is Easier than Reform",
				"140. We hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in such",
				"a way as to reconcile freedom with",
				"technology. The only way out is to dispense with the industrial-technological system altogether.",
				"This implies revolution, not",
				"necessarily an armed uprising,",
				"but certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature of society. 141. People tend to",
				"assume that because a revolution involves a much greater change than reform does,",
				"it is more difficult to bring about than",
				"reform is. Actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier than reform.",
				"The reason is that a revolutionary",
				"movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a reform movement",
				"cannot inspire. A reform movement merely offers",
				"to solve a particular social problem. A revolutionary movement",
				"offers to solve all problems at one stroke and create a whole",
				"new world; it provides the kind of ideal for which people will take",
				"great risks and make great sacrifices. For this reasons it",
				"would be much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to",
				"put effective, permanent restraints on the",
				"development or application of any one segment of technology, ",
				"such as genetic engineering, for example. Not many people will",
				"devote themselves with single-minded passion to imposing and maintaining",
				"restraints on genetic engineering, but under ",

				"suitable conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves passionately",
				"to a revolution against the industrialtechnological system. As we noted in ",
				"paragraph 132, reformers seeking to limit certain aspects of technology would be",
				"working to avoid a negative outcome. But revolutionaries work to gain a ",
				"powerful reward -- fulfillment of their revolutionary",
				"vision and therefore work harder and more persistently than reformers do.",
				"142. Reform is always restrained by the fear of painful consequences if changes go too far.",
				"But once a revolutionary fever has",
				"taken hold of a society, people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships",
				"for the sake of their revolution. This was clearly",
				"shown in the French and Russian Revolutions. It may be that in such cases",
				"only a minority of the population is really",
				"committed to the revolution, but this minority is sufficiently large and active",
				"so that it becomes the dominant force in society.",
				"We will have more to say about revolution in paragraphs 180-205.",
				"Control of Human Behavior",
				"143. Since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to",
				"put pressures on human beings of the sake of the",
				"functioning of the social organism. The kinds of pressures vary greatly from",
				"one society to another. Some of the pressures are",
				"physical (poor diet, excessive labor, environmental pollution), ",
				"some are psychological (noise, crowding, forcing human",
				"behavior into the mold that society requires). In the past,",
				"human nature has been approximately constant, or at any rate has",
				"varied only within certain bounds. Consequently, ",
				"societies have been able to push people only up to certain limits. When the",
				"limit of human endurance has been passed, things start going wrong: rebellion,",
				"or crime, or corruption, or evasion of work, or",
				"depression and other mental problems, or an elevated death rate,",
				"or a declining birth rate or something else, so that either the",
				"society breaks down, or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is ",
				"(quickly or gradually, through conquest, attrition or",
				"evolution) replaced by some more efficient form of society. [25]",
				"144. Thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies.",
				"People could be pushed only so far",
				"and no farther. But today this may be changing,",
				"because modern technology is developing ways of modifying human beings.",
				"145. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy,",
				"then gives them drugs to take away",
				"their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society.",
				"It is well known that the rate of",
				"clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades.",
				"We believe that this is due to disruption of the power process,",
				"as explained in paragraphs 59-76. But even if we are wrong,",
				"the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of SOME",
				"conditions that exist in today’s society.",
				"Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives",
				"them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means",
				"of modifying an individual’s internal state in such a way as to",
				"enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.",
				"(Yes, we know that depression is often of",
				"purely genetic origin. We are referring here to those cases in which environment ",
				"plays the predominant role.)",
				"146. Drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the new methods of",
				"controlling human behavior that modern society is",
				"developing. Let us look at some of the other methods.",
				"147. To start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. Hidden video ",
				"cameras are now used in most stores and in many",
				"other places, computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of",
				"information about individuals. Information so obtained",
				"greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion (i.e., law enforcement).",
				"[26] Then there are the methods of propaganda,",
				"for which the mass communication media provide effective vehicles.",
				"Efficient techniques have been developed for winning",
				"elections, selling products, influencing public opinion.",
				"The entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of",
				"the system, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence.",
				"Entertainment provides modern man with",
				"an essential means of escape. While absorbed in television, videos, etc., ",
				"he can forget stress, anxiety, frustration,",
				"dissatisfaction. Many primitive peoples, when they don’t have work to do, ",
				"    are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing",
				"nothing at all, because they are at peace with themselves and their world. ",
				"But most modern people must be constantly occupied",
				"or entertained, otherwise they get “bored,” i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy,",
				"irritable.",
				"148. Other techniques strike deeper than the foregoing. Education is no ",
				"longer a simple affair of paddling a kid’s behind when",
				"he doesn’t know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them.",
				"It is becoming a scientific technique for",
				"controlling the child’s development. Sylvan Learning Centers, for example,",
				"have had great success in motivating children to",
				"study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success",
				"in many conventional schools. “Parenting”",
				"techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept ",
				"fundamental values of the system and behave in",
				"ways that the system finds desirable. “Mental health” programs, “intervention”",
				"techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are",
				"ostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually serve",
				"as methods for inducing individuals to think and",
				"behave as the system requires. (There is no contradiction here; an individual",
				"    whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict",
				"with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to ",
				"conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer from",
				"stress, frustration, defeat. His path will be much easier if he thinks",
				"and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system",
				"is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him ",
				"into conformity.) Child abuse in its gross and obvious forms",
				"is disapproved in most if not all cultures. Tormenting a child for a ",
				"trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls",
				"almost everyone. But many psychologists interpret the concept of ",
				"abuse much more broadly. Is spanking, when used as part of",
				"a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse?",
				"The question will ultimately be decided by whether or not",
				"spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in ",
				"well with the existing system of society. In practice, the word",
				"“abuse” tends to be interpreted to include any method of",
				"child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system.",
				"Thus, when they go beyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty,",
				"programs for preventing “child abuse” are directed",
				"toward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system.",
				"149. Presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness",
				"of psychological techniques for controlling human",
				"behavior. But we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques",
				"alone will be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of",
				"society that technology is creating. Biological methods probably",
				"will have to be used. We have already mentioned the use of",
				"drugs in this connection. Neurology may provide other avenues for",
				"modifying the human mind. Genetic engineering of human",
				"beings is already beginning to occur in the form of “gene therapy,”",
				"and there is no reason to assume that such methods will not",
				"eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect",
				"mental functioning.",
				"150. As we mentioned in paragraph 134, industrial society seems ",
				"likely to be entering a period of severe stress, due in part to",
				"problems of human behavior and in part to economic and ",
				"environmental problems. And a considerable proportion of the",
				"system’s economic and environmental problems result from",
				"the way human beings behave. Alienation, low self-esteem,",
				"depression, hostility, rebellion; children who won’t",
				"study, youth gangs, illegal drug use, rape, child abuse, other crimes, unsafe",
				"sex, teen pregnancy, population growth, political ",
				"corruption, race hatred, ethnic rivalry, bitter ",
				"ideological conflict (e.g., prochoice vs. pro-life),",
				"political extremism, terrorism, sabotage, anti-government groups,",
				"hate groups. All these threaten the very",
				"survival of the system. The system will therefore be FORCED to use",
				"every practical means of controlling human behavior.",
				"151. The social disruption that we see today is certainly not ",
				"the result of mere chance. It can only be a result of the conditions",
				"of life that the system imposes on people. (We have argued that ",
				"the most important of these conditions is disruption of the",
				"power process.) If the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient",
				"control over human behavior to assure its own survival, a new",
				"watershed in human history will have been passed. Whereas formerly",
				"the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on",
				"the development of societies (as we explained in Paragraphs 143, 144),",
				"industrial-technological society will be able to pass",
				"those limits by modifying human beings, whether by psychological methods",
				"or biological methods or both. In the future, social",
				"systems will not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. Instead,",
				"human being will be adjusted to suit the needs of the",
				"system. [27]",
				"152. generally speaking, technological control over human behavior will",
				"probably not be introduced with a totalitarian",
				"intention or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom.",
				"[28] Each new step in the assertion of control over the",
				"human mind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces society,",
				"such as curing alcoholism, reducing the crime",
				"rate or inducing young people to study science and engineering.",
				"In many cases there will be a humanitarian justification. For",

				"he is clearly doing that individual a favor. It",

				"When Parents send their children to Sylvan Learning",
				"Centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about their studies,",
				"they do so from concern for their children’s",
				"welfare. It may be that some of these parents wish that one didn’t have to have specialized",
				"training to get a job and that their",
				"kid didn’t have to be brainwashed into becoming a computer nerd.",
				"But what can they do? They can’t change society, and their",
				"child may be unemployable if he doesn’t have certain skills.",
				"So they send him to Sylvan.",
				"153. Thus control over human behavior will be introduced not by a calculated decision",
				"of the authorities but through a process",
				"of social evolution (RAPID evolution, however). The process will be impossible to resist,",
				"because each advance, considered by",
				"itself, will appear to be beneficial, ",
				"or at least the evil involved in making the advance will ",
				"appear to be beneficial, or at least the",
				"evil involved in making the advance will seem to be less than ",
				"that which would result from not making it (see paragraph 127).",
				"Propaganda for example is used for many good purposes, such as ",
				"discouraging child abuse or race hatred. [14] Sex education is",
				"obviously useful, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent ",
				"    that it is successful) is to take the shaping of sexual attitudes",
				"away from the family and put it into the hands of the state as ",

				"154. Suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the ",
				"likelihood that a child will grow up to be a criminal, and suppose",
				"some sort of gene therapy can remove this trait. [29] Of course ",
				"most parents whose children possess the trait will have them",
				"undergo the therapy. It would be inhumane to do otherwise, since",
				"    the child would probably have a miserable life if he grew up",
				"to be a criminal. But many or most primitive societies have a low ",
				"crime rate in comparison with that of our society, even",

				"though they have neither high-tech methods of child-rearing nor harsh ",
				"systems of punishment. Since there is no reason to",
				"suppose that more modern men than primitive men have innate predatory ",
				"tendencies, the high crime rate of our society must be",
				"due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people, to which",
				"many cannot or will not adjust. Thus a treatment designed",
				"to remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of",
				"re-engineering people so that they suit the requirements of",
				"the system.",
				"155. Our society tends to regard as a “sickness” any mode of thought",
				"or behavior that is inconvenient for the system, and this is",
				"plausible because when an individual doesn’t fit into the system it ",
				"causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the",
				"system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the",
				"system is seen as a “cure” for a “sickness” and therefore as",
				"good.",
				"156. In paragraph 127 we pointed out that if the use of a new item ",
				"of technology is INITIALLY optional, it does not",
				"necessarily REMAIN optional, because the new technology tends to ",
				"change society in such a way that it becomes difficult or",
				"impossible for an individual to function without using that technology.",
				"    This applies also to the technology of human behavior.",
				"In a world in which most children are put through a program to make them",
				"enthusiastic about studying, a parent will almost be",
				"forced to put his kid through such a program, because if he does not, ",
				"then the kid will grow up to be, comparatively speaking,",
				"an ignoramus and therefore unemployable. Or suppose a biological treatment",
				"is discovered that, without undesirable sideeffects, will greatly reduce",
				"the psychological stress from which so many people suffer in our society. If large numbers of",
				"people choose to undergo the treatment, then the general level of stress ",
				"    in society will be reduced, so that it will be possible for",
				"the system to increase the stress-producing pressures. In fact, something ",
				"like this seems to have happened already with one of",
				"our society’s most important psychological tools for enabling people to",
				"reduce (or at least temporarily escape from) stress,",
				"namely, mass entertainment (see paragraph 147). Our use of mass",
				"entertainment is “optional”: No law requires us to watch",
				"television, listen to the radio, read magazines. Yet mass entertainment ",
				"is a means of escape and stress-reduction on which most",
				"of us have become dependent. Everyone complains about the trashiness",
				"of television, but almost everyone watches it. A few",
				"have kicked the TV habit, but it would be a rare person who could get ",
				"along today without using ANY form of mass",
				"entertainment. (Yet until quite recently in human history most people",
				"got along very nicely with no other entertainment than",

				"157. Assuming that industrial society survives, it is likely that",
				"technology will eventually acquire something approaching",
				"complete control over human behavior. It has been established ",
				"beyond any rational doubt that human thought and behavior",
				"have a largely biological basis. As experimenters have demonstrated,",
				"feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be",
				"turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate parts of ",
				"the brain. Memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of",
				"the brain or they can be brought to the surface by electrical stimulation.",
				"Hallucinations can be induced or moods changed by",
				"drugs. There may or may not be an immaterial human soul, but if ",
				"there is one it clearly is less powerful that the biological",

				"158. It presumably would be impractical for all people to have ",
				"electrodes inserted in their heads so that they could be",
				"controlled by the authorities. But the fact that human thoughts ",
				"and feelings are so open to biological intervention shows that the",
				"problem of controlling human behavior is mainly a technical problem; ",
				"a problem of neurons, hormones and complex",
				"molecules; the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific attack. ",
				"Given the outstanding record of our society in solving",
				"technical problems, it is overwhelmingly probable that great advances",
				"will be made in the control of human behavior.",
				"159. Will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological",
				"control of human behavior? It certainly would if an",
				"attempt were made to introduce such control all at once. But since ",
				"technological control will be introduced through a long",
				"sequence of small advances, there will be no rational and effective",
				"public resistance. (See paragraphs 127, 132, 153.)",
				"160. To those who think that all this sounds like science fiction,",
				"we point out that yesterday’s science fiction is today’s fact.",
				"The Industrial Revolution has radically altered man’s environment ",

				"and way of life have been.",
				"Human Race at a Crossroads",

				"161. But we have gotten ahead of our story. It is one thing to ",
				"develop in the laboratory a series of psychological or biological",
				"techniques for manipulating human behavior and quite another to ",
				"integrate these techniques into a functioning social system.",
				"The latter problem is the more difficult of the two. For example, ",
				"while the techniques of educational psychology doubtless",
				"work quite well in the “lab schools” where they are developed, ",
				"it is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout",
				"our educational system. We all know what many of our schools are ",
				"like. The teachers are too busy taking knives and guns",
				"away from the kids to subject them to the latest techniques for ",
				"making them into computer nerds. Thus, in spite of all its",
				"technical advances relating to human behavior, the system to date",
				"has not been impressively successful in controlling human",
				"beings. The people whose behavior is fairly well under the control",
				"of the system are those of the type that might be called",
				"“bourgeois.” But there are growing numbers of people who in one ",
				"way or another are rebels against the system: welfare",
				"leaches, youth gangs, cultists. Satanists, nazis, radical",

				"162. The system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle",
				"to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival, among",

				"If the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over",
				"human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise",

				"resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years.",
				"163. Suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades.",
				"By that time it will have to have solved, or at least",
				"brought under control, the principal problems that confront it, in ",
				"particular that of “socializing” human beings; that is, making",
				"people sufficiently docile so that heir behavior no longer threatens the system.",
				"That being accomplished, it does not appear that",
				"there would be any further obstacle to the development of technology, ",
				"and it would presumably advance toward its logical",
				"conclusion, which is complete control over everything on Earth, ",
				"including human beings and all other important organisms.",
				"The system may become a unitary, monolithic organization, or",
				"it may be more or less fragmented and consist of a number of",
				"organizations coexisting in a relationship that includes elements of both",
				"cooperation and competition, just as today the",
				"government, the corporations and other large organizations both cooperate",
				"and compete with one another. Human freedom",
				"mostly will have vanished, because individuals and small groups will be impotent",
				"vis-a-vis large organizations armed with",
				"super-technology and an arsenal of advanced psychological and biological tools",
				"for manipulating human beings, besides",
				"instruments of surveillance and physical coercion.",
				"Only a small number of people will have any real power, and even these",
				"probably will have only very limited freedom, because their behavior too will be regulated;",
				"just as today our politicians and",
				"corporation executives can retain their positions of power only",
				"as long as their behavior remains within certain fairly narrow",
				"limits.",
				"164. Don’t imagine that the systems will stop developing further techniques",
				"for controlling human beings and nature once the",
				"crisis of the next few decades is over and increasing control",
				"is no longer necessary for the system’s survival. On the contrary,",
				"once the hard times are over the system will increase its control over people",
				"and nature more rapidly, because it will no longer",
				"be hampered by difficulties of the kind that it is currently experiencing.",
				"Survival is not the principal motive for extending",
				"control. As we explained in paragraphs 87-90,",
				"technicians and scientists carry on their work largely as a surrogate activity; that",
				"is, they satisfy their need for power by solving technical problems.",
				"They will continue to do this with unabated enthusiasm, and",
				"among the most interesting and challenging problems for them to solve will",
				"be those of understanding the human body and",
				"mind and intervening in their development. For the “good of humanity,” of course.",
				"165. But suppose on the other hand that the stresses of the coming decades prove",
				"to be too much for the system. If the system",
				"breaks down there may be a period of chaos, a “time of troubles” such as those",
				"that history has recorded at various epochs in",
				"the past. It is impossible to predict what would emerge from such a",
				"time of troubles, but at any rate the human race would be",
				"given a new chance. The greatest danger is that industrial society",
				"may begin to reconstitute itself within the first few years after",
				"the breakdown. Certainly there will be many people (power-hungry types especially) ",
				"who will be anxious to get the factories",
				"running again.",
				"166. Therefore two tasks confront those who hate the servitude",
				"to which the industrial system is reducing the human race. First,",
				"we must work to heighten the social stresses within the system",
				"so as to increase the likelihood that it will break down or be",
				"weakened sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes",
				"possible. Second, it is necessary to develop and propagate an",
				"ideology that opposes technology and the industrial society ",
				"if and when the system becomes sufficiently weakened. And such",
				"an ideology will help to assure that, if and when industrial ",
				"society breaks down, its remnants will be smashed beyond repair, so",
				"that the system cannot be reconstituted. The factories should be",
				"destroyed, technical books burned, etc.",
				"Human Suffering",
				"167. The industrial system will not break down purely as a result",
				"of revolutionary action. It will not be vulnerable to",
				"revolutionary attack unless its own internal problems of ",
				"development lead it into very serious difficulties. So if the system",
				"breaks down it will do so either spontaneously, or through",
				"a process that is in part spontaneous but helped along by",
				"revolutionaries. If the breakdown is sudden, many people will die,",
				"since the world’s population has become so over-grown that",
				"it cannot even feed itself any longer without advanced technology.",
				"Even if the breakdown is gradual enough so that reduction",
				"of the population can occur more through lowering of the birth rate than through",
				"elevation of the death rate, the process of deindustrialization probably",
				"will be very chaotic and involve much suffering.",
				"It is naive to think it likely that technology can be",
				"phased out in a smoothly managed, orderly way, especially since ",
				"the technophiles will fight stubbornly at every step. Is it",
				"therefore cruel to work for the breakdown of the system? Maybe, ",
				"but maybe not. In the first place, revolutionaries will not be",
				"able to break the system down unless it is already in enough trouble ",
				"so that there would be a good chance of its eventually",
				"breaking down by itself anyway; and the bigger the system grows,",
				"the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will",
				"be; so it may be that revolutionaries, by hastening the onset of the breakdown,",
				"will be reducing the extent of the disaster.",
				"168. In the second place, one has to balance struggle and death",
				"against the loss of freedom and dignity. To many of us, freedom",
				"and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of",
				"physical pain. Besides, we all have to die some time, and it may",
				"be better to die fighting for survival, or for a cause, than to ",
				"live a long but empty and purposeless life.",
				"169. In the third place, it is not at all certain that survival",
				"of the system will lead to less suffering than breakdown of the system",
				"would. The system has already caused, and is continuing to cause,",
				"immense suffering all over the world. Ancient cultures, that",
				"for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory relationship with",
				"each other and with their environment, have been shattered",
				"by contact with industrial society, and the result has been a whole",
				"catalogue of economic, environmental, social and",
				"psychological problems. One of the effects of the intrusion of ",
				"industrial society has been that over much of the world",
				"traditional controls on population have been thrown out of balance.",
				"Hence the population explosion, with all that that implies.",
				"Then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread",
				"throughout the supposedly fortunate countries of the West (see",
				"paragraphs 44, 45). No one knows what will happen as a result",
				"of ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect and other",
				"environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen. And,",
				"as nuclear proliferation has shown, new technology cannot be kept",
				"out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible Third World nations.",
				"Would you like to speculate about what Iraq or North",
				"Korea will do with genetic engineering?",
				"170. “Oh!” say the technophiles, “Science is going to fix all that!",
				"We will conquer famine, eliminate psychological suffering,",
				"make everybody healthy and happy!” Yeah, sure. That’s what they said 200 years ago.",
				"The Industrial Revolution was supposed",
				"to eliminate poverty, make everybody happy, etc. The actual result has been quite different.",
				"The technophiles are hopelessly",
				"naive (or self-deceiving) in their understanding of social problems. They are unaware of ",
				"(or choose to ignore) the fact that",
				"when large changes, even seemingly beneficial ones, are introduced into a society, they lead to a long sequence of other",
				"changes, most of which are impossible to predict (paragraph 103). ",
				"The result is disruption of the society. So it is very probable",
				"that in their attempts to end poverty and disease, engineer docile,",
				"happy personalities and so forth, the technophiles will create",
				"social systems that are terribly troubled, even more so than the present once. ",
				"For example, the scientists boast that they will end",
				"famine by creating new, genetically engineered food plants.",
				"But this will allow the human population to keep expanding",
				"indefinitely, and it is well known that crowding leads to increased stress and aggression.",
				"This is merely one example of the",
				"PREDICTABLE problems that will arise. We emphasize that, as past experience has shown,",
				"technical progress will lead to",
				"other new problems that CANNOT be predicted in advance (paragraph 103).",
				"In fact, ever since the Industrial Revolution,",
				"technology has been creating new problems for society far more rapidly ",
				"than it has been solving old ones. Thus it will take a",
				"long and difficult period of trial and error for the technophiles to ",
				"work the bugs out of their Brave New World (if they every",
				"do). In the meantime there will be great suffering. So it is not at ",
				"all clear that the survival of industrial society would involve",
				"less suffering than the breakdown of that society would. Technology",
				"has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is",
				"not likely to be any easy escape.",
				"The Future",
				"171. But suppose now that industrial society does survive the next ",
				"several decades and that the bugs do eventually get worked",
				"out of the system, so that it functions smoothly. What kind of system will it be?",
				"We will consider several possibilities.",
				"172. First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in ",
				"developing intelligent machines that can do all things better",
				"than human beings can do them. In that case presumably all work will ",
				"be done by vast, highly organized systems of machines",
				"and no human effort will be necessary. Either of two cases might occur.",
				"The machines might be permitted to make all of their",
				"own decisions without human oversight, or else human control over the",
				"machines might be retained.",
				"173. If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions,",
				"we can’t make any conjectures as to the results, because it is",
				"impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that ",
				"the fate of the human race would be at the mercy",
				"of the machines. It might be argued that the human race would never be ",
				"foolish enough to hand over all power to the machines.",
				"But we are suggesting neither that the human race would voluntarily",
				"turn power over to the machines nor that the machines",
				"would willfully seize power. What we do suggest is that the human",
				"race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of",
				"such dependence on the machines that it would have no practical ",
				"choice but to accept all of the machines’ decisions. As society",
				"and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as",
				"machines become more and more intelligent, people will",
				"let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply",
				"because machine-made decisions will bring better results",
				"than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the",
				"decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so",
				"complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently.",
				"At that stage the machines will be in effective",
				"control. People won’t be able to just turn the machine off, because they ",
				"will be so dependent on them that turning them off",
				"would amount to suicide.",
				"174. On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines ",
				"may be retained. In that case the average man may",
				"have control over certain private machines of his own, such as his car or",
				"his personal computer, but control over large systems",
				"of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite -- just as it is today,",
				"but with two differences. Due to improved techniques the",
				"elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work",
				"will no longer be necessary the masses will be",
				"superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless",
				"they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of",
				"humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other",
				"psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate",
				"until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to",
				"the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they",
				"may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the ",
				"human race. They will see to it that everyone’s physical needs",
				"are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically",
				"hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to",
				"keep him busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes ",
				"“treatment” to cure his “problem.” Of course, life will",
				"be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or ",
				"psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the",
				"power process or to make them “sublimate” their drive for power into some",
				"harmless hobby. These engineered human beings",
				"may be happy in such a society, but they most certainly will not be free.",
				"They will have been reduced to the status of domestic",
				"animals.",
				"175. But suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in ",
				"developing artificial intelligence, so that human work",
				"remains necessary. Even so, machines will take care of more and more",
				"of the simpler tasks so that there will be an increasing",
				"surplus of human workers at the lower levels of ability. (We see",
				"    this happening already. There are many people who find it",
				"difficult or impossible to get work, because for intellectual or ",
				"psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training",
				"necessary to make themselves useful in the present system.) ",
				"On those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be",
				"placed: They will need more and more training, more and more ability,",
				"and will have to be ever more reliable, conforming and",
				"docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant ",
				"organism. Their tasks will be increasingly specialized, so that",
				"their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world,",
				"being concentrated on one tiny slice of reality. The system will",
				"have to use any means that it can, whether psychological or biological, ",
				"to engineer people to be docile, to have the abilities that",
				"the system requires and to “sublimate” their drive for power into some",
				"specialized task. But the statement that the people of",
				"such a society will have to be docile may require qualification. ",
				"The society may find competitiveness useful, provided that",
				"ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that ",
				"serve the needs of the system. We can imagine a future society",
				"in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige ",
				"and power. But no more than a very few people will ever reach",
				"the top, where the only real power is (see end of paragraph 163).",
				"Very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his",
				"need for power only by pushing large numbers of other people out",
				"of the way and depriving them of THEIR opportunity for",
				"power.",
				"176. One can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more ",
				"than one of the possibilities that we have just discussed. For",
				"instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work",
				"that is of real, practical importance, but that human beings",
				"will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. It ",
				"has been suggested, for example, that a great development of",
				"the service industries might provide work for human beings. Thus ",
				"people would spent their time shining each other’s shoes,",
				"driving each other around in taxicabs, making handicrafts for one",
				"another, waiting on each other’s tables, etc. This seems to us",
				"a thoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and ",
				"we doubt that many people would find fulfilling lives in such",
				"pointless busy-work. They would seek other, dangerous outlets ",
				"(drugs, crime, “cults,” hate groups) unless they were",
				"biologically or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such ",
				"a way of life.",
				"177. Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust ",
				"all the possibilities. They only indicate the kinds of outcomes",
				"that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible",
				"scenarios that are any more palatable than the ones we’ve just",
				"described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-technological",
				"system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by",
				"that time have developed certain general characteristics: Individuals",
				"(at least those of the “bourgeois” type, who are integrated",
				"into the system and make it run, and who therefore have all",
				"the power) will be more dependent than ever on large",
				"organizations; they will be more “socialized” than ever and their",
				"physical and mental qualities to a significant extent (possibly",
				"to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them ",
				"rather than being the results of chance (or of God’s will, or",
				"whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to",
				"remnants preserved for scientific study and kept under",
				"the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no longer",
				"be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from",
				"now) it is likely that neither the human race nor any other important ",
				"organisms will exist as we know them today, because once",
				"you start modifying organisms through genetic engineering there is ",
				"no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the",
				"modifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed.",
				"178. Whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating for",
				"    human beings a new physical and social",
				"environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural",
				"selection has adapted the human race",
				"physically and psychologically. If man is not adjusted to this new environment ",
				"by being artificially re-engineered, then he will",
				"be adapted to it through a long and painful process of natural selection.",
				"The former is far more likely than the latter.",
				"179. It would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences.",
				"Strategy",
				"180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown.",
				"Many people understand something of",
				"what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it ",
				"because they think it is inevitable. But we (FC)",
				"don’t think it is inevitable. We think it can be stopped, and we will give here",
				"some indications of how to go about stopping it.",
				"181. As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to",
				"promote social stress and instability in industrial",
				"society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and",
				"the industrial system. When the system becomes",
				"sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against technology may",
				"be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the",
				"French and Russian Revolutions. French society and Russian society, ",
				"for several decades prior to their respective revolutions,",
				"showed increasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies",
				"were being developed that offered a new world view",
				"that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case,",
				"revolutionaries were actively working to undermine the old",
				"order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional ",
				"stress (by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in",
				"Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we propose is something ",
				"along the same lines.",
				"182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were ",
				"failures. But most revolutions have two goals. One is to",
				"destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form ",
				"of society envisioned by the revolutionaries. The French",
				"and Russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the new ",
				"kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite",
				"successful in destroying the old society. We have no illusions about",
				"the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. Our",
				"goal is only to destroy the existing form of society.",
				"183. But an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must",
				"have a positive ideal as well as a negative one; it must be FOR",
				"something as well as AGAINST something. The positive ideal that we ",
				"propose is Nature. That is, WILD nature: those aspects",
				"of the functioning of the Earth and its living things that are ",
				"independent of human management and free of human interference",
				"and control. And with wild nature we include human nature, by",
				"which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human",
				"individual that are not subject to regulation by organized ",

				"your religious or philosophical opinions).",
				"184. Nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. ",
				"Nature (that which is outside the power of the",
				"system) is the opposite of technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the",
				"power of the system). Most people will agree that",
				"nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. The radical ",
				"environmentalists ALREADY hold an ideology that",
				"exalts nature and opposes technology. [30] It is not necessary for the sake",
				"of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any",
				"new kind of social order. Nature takes care of itself: It was a ",
				"spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society,",
				"and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies",
				"coexisted with nature without doing it an excessive amount",
				"of damage. Only with the Industrial Revolution did the effect of",
				"human society on nature become really devastating. To relieve",
				"the pressure on nature it is not necessary to create a special ",
				"kind of social system, it is only necessary to get rid of industrial",
				"society. Granted, this will not solve all problems. Industrial society",
				"has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will",
				"take a very long time for the scars to heal. Besides,",
				"even pre-industrial societies can do significant damage to nature.",
				"Nevertheless, getting rid of industrial society will accomplish a great deal.",
				"It will relieve the worst of the pressure on nature so",
				"that the scars can begin to heal. It will remove the capacity of",
				"organized society to keep increasing its control over nature ",
				"(including human nature). Whatever kind of society may exist after ",
				"the demise of the industrial system, it is certain that most",
				"people will live close to nature, because in the absence of advanced",
				"technology there is no other way that people CAN live. To",
				"feed themselves they must be peasants or herdsmen or fishermen or ",
				"hunters, etc. And, generally speaking, local autonomy",
				"should tend to increase, because lack of advanced technology and ",
				"rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments",
				"or other large organizations to control local communities.",
				"185. As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society",
				"-- well, you can’t eat your cake and have it too. To gain",
				"one thing you have to sacrifice another.",
				"186. Most people hate psychological conflict. For this reason they",
				"avoid doing any serious thinking about difficult social",
				"issues, and they like to have such issues presented to them in simple,",
				"black-and-white terms: THIS is all good and THAT is all",
				"bad. The revolutionary ideology should therefore be developed on two levels.",
				"187. On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself",
				"to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational.",
				"The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to ",
				"the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis,",
				"with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and",
				"of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the",
				"system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type,",
				"as they are capable people and will be instrumental in",
				"influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. ",
				"Facts should never intentionally be",
				"distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean",
				"that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in",
				"making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth",
				"or doing anything else that would destroy the",
				"intellectual respectability of the ideology.",
				"188. On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form ",
				"that will enable the unthinking majority to see",
				"the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this ",
				"second level the ideology should not be expressed",
				"in language that is so cheap, intemperate ",
				"or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap,",
				"intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains,",
				"but it will be more advantageous in the long run to",
				"keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people",
				"than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob",
				"who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick.",
				"However, propaganda of",
				"the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse",
				"and there is a final struggle between",
				"rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under.",
				"189. Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority",
				"of people on their side. History is",
				"made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear",
				"and consistent idea of what it really",
				"wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution [31], the task of",
				"revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow",
				"support of the majority than to build a small core of deeply committed people. As ",
				"for the majority, it will be enough to make",
				"them aware of the existence of the new ideology and remind them of it frequently; ",
				"though of course it will be desirable to get",
				"majority support to the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of",
				"seriously committed people.",
				"190. Any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should",
				"be careful about what kind of conflict one",
				"encourages. The line of conflict should be drawn between the mass of the people ",
				"and the power-holding elite of industrial",
				"society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business executives, government ",
				"    officials, etc.). It should NOT be drawn between",
				"the revolutionaries and the mass of the people. For example, it would be bad ",
				"strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn",
				"Americans for their habits of consumption. Instead, the average American should",
				"be portrayed as a victim of the advertising",
				"and marketing industry, which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he ",
				"doesn’t need and that is very poor",
				"compensation for his lost freedom. Either approach is consistent with the facts.",
				"It is merely a matter of attitude whether you",
				"blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public ",
				"for allowing itself to be manipulated. As a",
				"matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the public.",
				"191. One should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that ",
				"between the power-holding elite (which",
				"wields technology) and the general public (over which technology exerts its power).",
				"For one thing, other conflicts tend to",
				"distract attention from the important conflicts (between power-elite and ordinary ",
				"    people, between technology and nature); for",
				"another thing, other conflicts may actually tend to encourage technologization, ",
				"because each side in such a conflict wants to",
				"use technological power to gain advantages over its adversary. This is clearly ",
				"seen in rivalries between nations. It also appears",
				"in ethnic conflicts within nations. For example, in America many black leaders",
				"are anxious to gain power for African",
				"Americans by placing back individuals in the technological power-elite.",
				"They want there to be many black government",
				"officials, scientists, corporation executives and so forth. In this way ",
				"they are helping to absorb the African American subculture",
				"into the technological system. Generally speaking, one should encourage",
				"only those social conflicts that can be fitted into the",
				"framework of the conflicts of power-elite vs. ordinary people, technology vs. nature.",
				"192. But the way to discourage ethnic conflict is NOT through",
				"militant advocacy of minority rights (see paragraphs 21, 29).",
				"Instead, the revolutionaries should emphasize that although minorities",
				"do suffer more or less disadvantage, this disadvantage is",
				"of peripheral significance. Our real enemy is the industrial- technological system,",
				"and in the struggle against the system, ethnic",
				"distinctions are of no importance.",
				"193. The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve",
				"an armed uprising against any government. It may or",
				"may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. ",
				"Its focus will be on technology and economics,",
				"not politics. [32]",
				"194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power,",
				"whether by legal or illegal means, until the",
				"industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself",
				"to be a failure in the eyes of most people. Suppose for",
				"example that some “green” party ",
				"should win control of the United States Congress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or",
				"watering down their own ideology they would have to take vigorous ",
				"measures to turn economic growth into economic",
				"shrinkage. To the average man the results would appear disastrous:",
				"There would be massive unemployment, shortages of",
				"commodities, etc Even if the grosser ill effects could be avoided",
				"through superhumanly skillful management, still people would",
				"have to begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become ",
				"addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the “green” party would",
				"be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered ",
				"a severe setback. For this reason the revolutionaries should",
				"not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten",
				"itself into such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting",
				"from the failures of the industrial system itself and not from",
				"the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against",
				"technology will probably have to be a revolution by outsiders,",
				"a revolution from below and not from above.",
				"195. The revolution must be international and worldwide. ",
				"It cannot be carried out on a nation-by-nation basis. Whenever it is",
				"suggested that the United States, for example, should cut back on technological progress",
				"or economic growth, people get",
				"hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in technology the Japanese",
				"will get ahead of us. Holy robots! The world",
				"will fly off its orbit if the Japanese ever sell more cars than we do! ",
				"(Nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) More",
				"reasonably, it is argued that if the relatively democratic nations ",
				"of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial",
				"nations like China, Vietnam and North Korea continue to progress, ",
				"eventually the dictators may come to dominate the world.",
				"That is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations",
				"simultaneously, to the extent that this may be possible. True,",
				"there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed ",
				"at approximately the same time all over the world, and it is",
				"even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the system could ",
				"lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators. That",
				"is a risk that has to be taken. And it is worth taking, since the",
				"difference between a “democratic” industrial system and one",
				"controlled by dictators is small compared with the difference",
				"between an industrial system and a non-industrial one. [33] It",
				"might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by",
				"dictators would be preferable, because dictator-controlled systems",
				"usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more",
				"likely to break down. Look at Cuba.",
				"196. Revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend ",
				"to bind the world economy into a unified whole. Free trade",
				"agreements like NAFTA and GATT are probably harmful to the",
				"environment in the short run, but in the long run they may",
				"perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence ",
				"between nations. It will be easier to destroy the",
				"industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy is so ",
				"unified that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead",
				"to its breakdown in all industrialized nations.",
				"197. Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, ",
				"too much control over nature; they argue for a more",
				"passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people",
				"are expressing themselves unclearly, because they fail to",
				"distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and power for",
				"INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a",
				"mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people ",
				"NEED power. Modern man as a collective entity -- that is,",
				"the industrial system -- has immense power over nature, and we ",
				"(FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and",
				"SMALL GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man",
				"ever did. Generally speaking, the vast power of",
				"“modern man” over nature is exercised not by individuals or small",
				"groups but by large organizations. To the extent that the",
				"average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology,",
				"he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only",
				"under the supervision and control of the system. ",
				"(You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and",
				"regulations.) The individual has only those technological powers",
				"with which the system chooses to provide him. His",
				"PERSONAL power over nature is slight.",
				"198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable ",
				"power over nature; or maybe it would be",
				"better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food ",
				"he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to",
				"track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect ",
				"himself from heat cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc.",
				"But primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because ",
				"the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible",
				"compared to the COLLECTIVE power of industrial society.",
				"199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power",
				"of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM",
				"should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and ",
				"freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS.",
				"200. Until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked,",
				"the destruction of that system must be the revolutionaries’",
				"ONLY goal. Other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal.",
				"More importantly if the revolutionaries",
				"permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of technology,",
				"they will be tempted to use technology as a tool",
				"for reaching that other goal. If they give in to that temptation,",
				"they will fall right back into the technological trap, because",
				"modern technology is a unified, tightly organized system, so that,",
				"in order to retain SOME technology, one finds oneself",
				"obliged to retain MOST technology,",
				"hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology.",
				"201. Suppose for example that the revolutionaries took ",
				"“social justice” as a goal. Human nature being what it is, social justice",
				"would not come about spontaneously;",
				"it would have to be enforced. In order to enforce it the revolutionaries would have to",
				"retain central organization and control.",
				"For that they would need rapid long-distance transportation and communication, and",
				"therefore all the technology needed to support the transportation and communication systems.",
				"To feed and clothe poor people",
				"they would have to use agricultural and manufacturing technology.",
				"And so forth. So that the attempt to insure social justice",
				"would force them to retain most parts of the technological system.",
				"Not that we have anything against social justice, but it must",
				"not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system.",
				"202. It would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the ",
				"system without using SOME modern technology. If nothing",
				"else they must use the communications media to spread their message.",
				"    But they should use modern technology for only ONE",
				"purpose: to attack the technological system.",
				"203. Imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him.",
				"Suppose he starts saying to himself, “Wine isn’t bad for",
				"you if used in moderation. Why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you!",
				"It won’t do me any harm if I take just",
				"one little drink....” Well you know what is going to happen.",
				"Never forget that the human race with technology is just like an",
				"alcoholic with a barrel of wine.",
				"204. Revolutionaries should have as many children as they can.",
				"There is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a",
				"significant extent inherited. No one suggests that a social attitude",
				"is a direct outcome of a person’s genetic constitution, but it",
				"appears that personality traits are partly inherited and that ",
				"certain personality traits tend, within the context of our society, to",
				"make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude. ",
				"Objections to these findings have been raised, but the objections",
				"are feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated. In any event,",
				"no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social",
				"attitudes similar to those of their parents. From our point of ",
				"view it doesn’t matter all that much whether the attitudes are",
				"passed on genetically or through childhood training. In either ",
				"case they ARE passed on.",
				"205. The trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to ",
				"rebel against the industrial system are also concerned about the",
				"population problems, hence they are apt to have few or no children. ",
				"In this way they may be handing the world over to the sort",
				"of people who support or at least accept the industrial system. ",
				"To insure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries",
				"the present generation should reproduce itself abundantly. In doing",
				"so they will be worsening the population problem only",
				"slightly. And the important problem is to get rid of the industrial",
				"system, because once the industrial system is gone the world’s",
				"population necessarily will decrease (see paragraph 167); whereas,",
				"if the industrial system survives, it will continue developing",
				"new techniques of food production that may enable the world’s ",
				"population to keep increasing almost indefinitely.",
				"206. With regard to revolutionary strategy, the only points on ",
				"which we absolutely insist are that the single overriding goal",
				"must be the elimination of modern technology, and that no other",
				"goal can be allowed to compete with this one. For the rest,",
				"revolutionaries should take an empirical approach. If experience ",
				"indicates that some of the recommendations made in the",
				"foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good results, then those",
				"recommendations should be discarded.",
				"Two Kinds of Technology",
				"207. An argument likely to be raised against our proposed revolution",
				"is that it is bound to fail, because (it is claimed)",
				"throughout history technology has always progressed, never regressed,",
				"hence technological regression is impossible. But this",
				"claim is false.",
				"208. We distinguish between two kinds of technology, which we will ",
				"call small-scale technology and organization-dependent",
				"technology. Small-scale technology is technology that can be used",
				"by small-scale communities without outside assistance. ",
				"Organization-dependent technology is technology that depends on",
				"large-scale social organization. We are aware of no",
				"significant cases of regression in small-scale technology.",
				"But organization-dependent technology DOES regress when the",
				"social organization on which it depends breaks down. Example:",
				"When the Roman Empire fell apart the Romans’ small-scale",
				"technology survived because any clever village craftsman could build,",
				"for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith could",
				"make steel by Roman methods, and so forth. But the Romans’ organization-",
				"dependent technology DID regress. Their",
				"aqueducts fell into disrepair and were never rebuilt. ",
				"Their techniques of road construction were lost. The Roman system of",
				"urban sanitation was forgotten, ",
				"so that not until rather recent times did the sanitation of European cities equal that of Ancient",
				"Rome.",
				"209. The reason why technology has seemed always to progress is that,",
				"until perhaps a century or two before the Industrial",
				"Revolution, most technology was small-scale technology.",
				"But most of the technology developed since the Industrial",
				"Revolution is organization-dependent technology. Take the refrigerator for example.",
				"Without factory-made parts or the",
				"facilities of a postindustrial machine shop it would be virtually impossible",
				"for a handful of local craftsmen to build a",
				"refrigerator. If by some miracle they did succeed in building one it would",
				"be useless to them without a reliable source of",
				"electric power. So they would have to dam a stream and build a generator.",
				"Generators require large amounts of copper wire.",
				"Imagine trying to make that wire without modern machinery. And where would ",
				"they get a gas suitable for refrigeration? It",
				"would be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking,",
				"as was done before the invention of the",
				"refrigerator.",
				"210. So it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken down,",
				"refrigeration technology would quickly be",
				"lost. The same is true of other organization-dependent technology.",
				"And once this technology had been lost for a generation or",
				"so it would take centuries to rebuild it,",
				"just as it took centuries to build it the first time around. Surviving technical books would",
				"be few and scattered. An industrial society, if built from scratch without outside help,",
				"can only be built in a series of stages:",
				"You need tools to make tools to make tools to make tools ... .",
				"A long process of economic development and progress in social",
				"organization is required. And, even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology,",
				"there is no reason to believe that",
				"anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial society.",
				"The enthusiasm for “progress” is a phenomenon peculiar to the",
				"modern form of society, and it seems not to have existed prior",
				"to the 17th century or thereabouts.",
				"211. In the late Middle Ages there were four main civilizations",
				"that were about equally “advanced”: Europe, the Islamic world,",
				"India, and the Far East (China, Japan, Korea). Three of those ",
				"civilizations remained more or less stable, and only Europe",
				"became dynamic. No one knows why Europe became dynamic at that ",
				"time; historians have their theories but these are only",
				"speculation. At any rate, it is clear that rapid development ",
				"toward a technological form of society occurs only under special",
				"conditions. So there is no reason to assume that a long-lasting ",
				"technological regression cannot be brought about.",
				"212. Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an",
				"industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in",
				"worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control ",
				"events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with",
				"by the people who will live at that time.",
				"The Danger of Leftism",
				"213. Because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement,",
				"leftists or persons of similar psychological type",
				"often are unattracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals",
				"and membership are not initially leftist. The resulting",
				"influx of leftish types can easily turn a non-leftist movement into a leftist one,",
				"so that leftist goals replace or distort the original",
				"goals of the movement.",
				"214. To avoid this, a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology",
				"must take a resolutely anti-leftist stance and must",
				"avoid all collaboration with leftists. Leftism is in the long run ",
				"inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the",
				"elimination of modern technology. Leftism is collectivist; ",
				"it seeks to bind together the entire world (both nature and the human",
				"race) into a unified whole. But this implies management of nature and ",
				"of human life by organized society, and it requires",
				"advanced technology. You can’t have a united world without rapid",
				"transportation and communication, you can’t make all",
				"people love one another without sophisticated psychological techniques,",
				"you can’t have a “planned society” without the",
				"necessary technological base. Above all, leftism is driven by the need",
				"for power, and the leftist seeks power on a collective",
				"basis, through identification with a mass movement or an organization.",
				"Leftism is unlikely ever to give up technology, because",
				"technology is too valuable a source of collective power.",
				"215. The anarchist [34] too seeks power, but he seeks it on an individual ",
				"or small-group basis; he wants individuals and small",
				"groups to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives.",
				"He opposes technology because it makes small groups",
				"dependent on large organizations.",
				"216. Some leftists may seem to oppose technology,",
				"but they will oppose it only so long as they are outsiders and the",
				"technological system is controlled by non-leftists.",
				"If leftism ever becomes dominant in society, so that the technological system",
				"becomes a tool in the hands of leftists, they will enthusiastically use it ",
				"and promote its growth. In doing this they will be",
				"repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in the past.",
				"When the Bolsheviks in Russia were outsiders, they",
				"vigorously opposed censorship and the secret police, they advocated ",
				"self-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth; but",
				"as soon as they came into power themselves, they imposed a tighter censorship",
				"and created a more ruthless secret police than",
				"any that had existed under the tsars,",
				"and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done. In the United",
				"States, a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities,",
				"leftist professors were vigorous proponents of",
				"academic freedom, but today, in those of our universities where leftists",
				"have become dominant, they have shown themselves",
				"ready to take away from everyone else’s academic freedom. ",
				"(This is “political correctness.”) The same will happen with leftists",
				"and technology: They will use it to oppress everyone else if they ",
				"ever get it under their own control.",
				"217. In earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type, ",
				"repeatedly, have first cooperated with non-leftist",
				"revolutionaries, as well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination,",
				"and later have double-crossed them to seize power for",
				"themselves. Robespierre did this in the French Revolution, ",
				"the Bolsheviks did it in the Russian Revolution, the communists did",
				"it in Spain in 1938 and Castro and his followers did it in Cuba. ",
				"Given the past history of leftism, it would be utterly foolish for",
				"non-leftist revolutionaries today to collaborate with leftists.",
				"218. Various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion. ",
				"Leftism is not a religion in the strict sense because",
				"leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural being.",
				"But, for the leftist, leftism plays a psychological role",
				"much like that which religion plays for some people. The leftist NEEDS to",
				"believe in leftism; it plays a vital role in his",
				"psychological economy. His beliefs are not easily modified by logic or facts.",
				"He has a deep conviction that leftism is morally",
				"Right with a capital R, and that he has not only a right but a duty to impose ",
				"leftist morality on everyone. (However, many of",
				"the people we are referring to as “leftists” do not think of themselves as ",
				"    leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs",
				"as leftism. We use the term “leftism” because we don’t know of any better",
				"words to designate the spectrum of related creeds",
				"that includes the feminist, gay rights, political correctness, etc.,",
				"movements, and because these movements have a strong",
				"affinity with the old left. See paragraphs 227-230.)",
				"219. Leftism is a totalitarian force. Wherever leftism is in a position of power",
				"it tends to invade every private corner and force",
				"every thought into a leftist mold. In part this is because of the quasi-religious ",
				"character of leftism; everything contrary to leftist",
				"beliefs represents Sin. More importantly, leftism is a totalitarian force because",
				"of the leftists’ drive for power. The leftist seeks",
				"to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement ",
				"and he tries to go through the power process by",
				"helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83).",
				"But no matter how far the movement has gone in",
				"attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism ",
				"is a surrogate activity (see paragraph 41). That is, the",
				"leftist’s real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism;",
				"in reality he is motivated by the sense of power he gets from",
				"struggling for and then reaching a social goal. [35] Consequently the leftist",
				"    is never satisfied with the goals he has already",
				"attained; his need for the power process leads him always to pursue some new ",
				"goal. The leftist wants equal opportunities for",
				"minorities. When that is attained he insists on statistical equality of ",
				"achievement by minorities. And as long as anyone harbors",
				"in some corner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minority, the ",
				"leftist has to re-educated him. And ethnic minorities",
				"are not enough; no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward ",
				"homosexuals, disabled people, fat people, old people,",
				"ugly people, and on and on and on. It’s not enough that the public should",
				"be informed about the hazards of smoking; a warning",
				"has to be stamped on every package of cigarettes. Then cigarette advertising ",
				"has to be restricted if not banned. The activists",
				"will never be satisfied until tobacco is outlawed, and after that it will be ",
				"alcohol, then junk food, etc. Activists have fought",
				"gross child abuse, which is reasonable. But now they want to stop all spanking.",
				"When they have done that they will want to ban",
				"something else they consider unwholesome, then another thing and then another.",
				"    They will never be satisfied until they have",
				"complete control over all child rearing practices. And then they will move on",
				"    to another cause.",
				"220. Suppose you asked leftists to make a list of ALL the things that ",
				"were wrong with society, and then suppose you instituted",
				"EVERY social change that they demanded. It is safe to say that within a ",
				"couple of years the majority of leftists would find",
				"something new to complain about, some new social “evil” to correct because,",
				"once again, the leftist is motivated less by",
				"distress at society’s ills than by the need to satisfy his drive for power",
				"by imposing his solutions on society.",
				"221. Because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior by ",
				"their high level of socialization, many leftists of the",
				"over-socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do. ",
				"    For them the drive for power has only one morally",
				"acceptable outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their morality on everyone.",
				"222. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are True ",
				"Believers in the sense of Eric Hoffer’s book, “The True",
				"Believer.” But not all True Believers are of the same psychological",
				"type as leftists. Presumably a true-believing nazi, for",
				"instance, is very different psychologically from a true-believing leftist.",
				"Because of their capacity for single-minded devotion to",
				"a cause, True Believers are a useful, perhaps a necessary, ingredient ",
				"of any revolutionary movement. This presents a problem",
				"with which we must admit we don’t know how to deal. We aren’t sure how ",
				"to harness the energies of the True Believer to a",
				"revolution against technology. At present all we can say is that no True ",
				"Believer will make a safe recruit to the revolution",
				"unless his commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology. ",
				"If he is committed also to another ideal, he may want to",
				"use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal (see paragraphs 220, 221).",
				"223. Some readers may say, “This stuff about leftism is a lot of crap. ",
				"I know John and Jane who are leftish types and they don’t",
				"have all these totalitarian tendencies.” It’s quite true that many leftists,",
				"possibly even a numerical majority, are decent people",
				"who sincerely believe in tolerating others’ values (up to a point)",
				"and wouldn’t want to use high-handed methods to reach their",
				"social goals. Our remarks about leftism are not meant to apply to every individual leftist ",
				"but to describe the general character of",
				"leftism as a movement. And the general character of a movement is not necessarily determined ",
				"by the numerical proportions of",
				"the various kinds of people involved in the movement.",
				"224. The people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements",
				"tend to be leftists of the most power-hungry type, because",
				"power-hungry people are those who strive hardest to get into positions",
				"of power. Once the power-hungry types have captured",
				"control of the movement, there are many leftists of a gentler breed who",
				"inwardly disapprove of many of the actions of the",
				"leaders, but cannot bring themselves to oppose them. They NEED their ",
				"faith in the movement, and because they cannot give up",
				"this faith they go along with the leaders. True, SOME leftists do have",
				"    the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that emerge,",
				"but they generally lose, because the power-hungry types are better",
				"organized, are more ruthless and Machiavellian and have",
				"taken care to build themselves a strong power base.",
				"225. These phenomena appeared clearly in Russia and other countries ",
				"that were taken over by leftists. Similarly, before the",
				"breakdown of communism in the, USSR, leftish types in the West would,",
				"seldom criticize that country. If prodded they would",
				"admit that the USSR did many wrong things, but then they would try to",
				"    find excuses for the communists and begin talking",
				"about the faults of the West. They always opposed Western military ",
				"resistance to communist aggression. Leftish types all over",
				"the world vigorously protested the U.S. military action in Vietnam, ",
				"but when the USSR invaded Afghanistan they did nothing.",
				"Not that they approved of the Soviet actions; but because of their ",
				"leftist faith, they just couldn’t bear to put themselves in",
				"opposition to communism. Today, in those of our universities where ",
				"“political correctness” has become dominant, there are",
				"probably many leftish types who privately disapprove of the ",
				"suppression of academic freedom, but they go along with it",
				"anyway.",
				"226. Thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally",
				"mild and fairly tolerant people by no means prevents leftism as a",
				"whole form having a totalitarian tendency.",
				"227. Our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. ",
				"It is still far from clear what we mean by the word “leftist.” There",
				"doesn’t seem to be much we can do about this. Today leftism is fragmented",
				"    into a whole spectrum of activist movements. Yet",
				"not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements ",
				"(e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both",
				"personalities of the leftist type and personalities of thoroughly",
				"un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate",
				"with leftists. Varieties of leftists fade out gradually into ",
				"varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed",
				"to decide whether a given individual is or is not a leftist.",
				"To the extent that it is defined at all, our conception of leftism is",
				"defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article, ",
				"and we can only advise the reader to use his own judgment in",
				"deciding who is a leftist.",
				"228. But it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism.",
				"These criteria cannot be applied in a cut and dried",
				"manner. Some individuals may meet some of the criteria without being leftists,",
				"some leftists may not meet any of the criteria.",
				"Again, you just have to use your judgment.",
				"229. The leftist is oriented toward large-scale collectivism.",
				"He emphasizes the duty of the individual to serve society and the",
				"duty of society to take care of the individual. He has a negative attitude ",
				"toward individualism. He often takes a moralistic tone.",
				"He tends to be for gun control, for sex education and other psychologically ",
				"“enlightened” educational methods, for social",
				"planning, for affirmative action, for multi- culturalism. He tends to ",
				"identify with victims. He tends to be against competition",
				"and against violence, but he often finds excuses for those leftists who ",
				"do commit violence. He is fond of using the common",
				"catch-phrases of the left, like “racism,” “sexism,” “homophobia,” “capitalism,” “imperialism,”",
				"“neocolonialism,” “genocide,”",
				"“social change,” “social justice,” “social responsibility.” ",
				"Maybe the best diagnostic trait of the leftist is his tendency to ",
				"sympathize with the following movements: feminism, gay rights, ",
				"ethnic rights, disability rights, animal rights, political",
				"correctness. Anyone who strongly sympathizes with ALL of these ",
				"movements is almost certainly a leftist. [36]",
				"230. The more dangerous leftists, that is, those who are most ",
				"power-hungry, are often characterized by arrogance or by a",
				"dogmatic approach to ideology. However, the most dangerous leftists ",
				"of all may be certain oversocialized types who avoid",
				"irritating displays of aggressiveness and refrain from advertising",
				"their leftism, but work quietly and unobtrusively to promote",
				"collectivist values, “enlightened” psychological techniques for",
				"socializing children, dependence of the individual on the",
				"system, and so forth. These crypto-leftists (as we may call them)",
				"approximate certain bourgeois types as far as practical action",
				"is concerned, but differ from them in psychology, ideology and motivation. ",
				"The ordinary bourgeois tries to bring people under",
				"control of the system in order to protect his way of life, or he does so simply",
				"because his attitudes are conventional. The",
				"crypto-leftist tries to bring people under control of the system because he is a True Believer ",
				"in a collectivist ideology. The",
				"crypto-leftist is differentiated from the average leftist of the oversocialized type",
				"by the fact that his rebellious impulse is",
				"weaker and he is more securely socialized. He is differentiated from the ordinary",
				"well-socialized bourgeois by the fact that",
				"there is some deep lack within him that makes it necessary for him to devote ",
				"himself to a cause and immerse himself in a",
				"collectivity. And maybe his (well-sublimated) drive for power is stronger than",
				"that of the average bourgeois.",
				"Final Note",
				"231. Throughout this article we’ve made imprecise statements and statements ",

				"for brevity made it impossible for us to formulate our assertions more precisely",

				"claim that this article expresses more than a crude approximation to the truth.",
				"232. All the same, we are reasonably confident that the general",
				"outlines of the picture we have painted here are roughly correct.",
				"Just one possible weak point needs to be mentioned. We have",
				"portrayed leftism in its modern form as a phenomenon peculiar",
				"to our time and as a symptom of the disruption of the power ",
				"process. But we might possibly be wrong about this.",
				"Oversocialized types who try to satisfy their drive for power ",
				"by imposing their morality on everyone have certainly been",
				"around for a long time. But we THINK that the decisive role ",
				"played by feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, powerlessness,",
				"identification with victims by people who are not themselves ",
				"victims, is a peculiarity of modern leftism. Identification with",
				"victims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some",
				"extent in 19th century leftism and early Christianity but as far as",
				"we can make out, symptoms of low self-esteem, etc., were not ",
				"nearly so evident in these movements, or in any other",
				"movements, as they are in modern leftism. But we are not in a ",
				"position to assert confidently that no such movements have",
				"existed prior to modern leftism. This is a significant question",
				"to which historians ought to give their attention.",
				"Notes",
				"1. (Paragraph 19) We are asserting that ALL, or even most, bullies",
				"and ruthless competitors suffer from feelings of inferiority.",
				"2. (Paragraph 25) During the Victorian period many oversocialized ",
				"people suffered from serious psychological problems as a",
				"result of repressing or trying to repress their sexual feelings. ",
				"Freud apparently based his theories on people of this type. Today",
				"the focus of socialization has shifted from sex to aggression.",
				"3. (Paragraph 27) Not necessarily including specialists in engineering or the “hard” sciences.",
				"4. (Paragraph 28) There are many individuals of the middle and upper ",
				"classes who resist some of these values, but usually their",
				"resistance is more or less covert. Such resistance appears in the mass",
				"media only to a very limited extent. The main thrust of",
				"propaganda in our society is in favor of the stated values.",
				"The main reason why these values have become, so to speak, the",
				"official values of our society is that they are useful to the industrial system.",
				"Violence is discouraged because it disrupts the",
				"functioning of the system. Racism is discouraged because ethnic conflicts",
				"also disrupt the system, and discrimination wastes",
				"the talents of minority-group members who could be useful to the system.",
				"Poverty must be “cured” because the underclass",
				"causes problems for the system and contact with the underclass lowers the",
				"morale of the other classes. Women are encouraged",
				"to have careers because their talents are useful to the system and,",
				"more importantly, because by having regular jobs women",
				"become better integrated into the system and tied directly to it rather than to their families.",
				"This helps to weaken family",
				"solidarity. (The leaders of the system say they want to strengthen the family,",
				"but they really mean is that they want the family",
				"to serve as an effective tool for socializing children in accord with the needs of the system.",
				"We argue in paragraphs 51, 52 that",
				"the system cannot afford to let the family or other small-scale social groups be strong or autonomous.)",
				"5. (Paragraph 42) It may be argued that the majority ",
				"of people don’t want to make their own decisions but want leaders to do",
				"their thinking for them. There is an element of truth in this.",
				"People like to make their own decisions in small matters, but",
				"making decisions on difficult, fundamental questions requires ",
				"facing up to psychological conflict, and most people hate",
				"psychological conflict. Hence they tend to lean on others in ",
				"making difficult decisions. But it does not follow that they like to",
				"have decisions imposed upon them without having any opportunity ",
				"to influence those decisions. The majority of people are",
				"natural followers, not leaders, but they like to have direct ",
				"personal access to their leaders, they want to be able to influence the",
				"leaders and participate to some extent in making even the difficult decisions.",
				"At least to that degree they need autonomy.",
				"6. (Paragraph 44) Some of the symptoms listed are similar to those shown by ",
				"caged animals. To explain how these symptoms",
				"arise from deprivation with respect to the power process: common-sense ",
				"understanding of human nature tells one that lack of",
				"goals whose attainment requires effort leads to boredom and that boredom,",
				"long continued, often leads eventually to",
				"depression. Failure to attain goals leads to frustration and lowering of ",
				"self-esteem. Frustration leads to anger, anger to",
				"aggression, often in the form of spouse or child abuse. It has been shown",
				"that long-continued frustration commonly leads to",
				"depression and that depression tends to cause guilt, sleep disorders, ",
				"eating disorders and bad feelings about oneself. Those who",
				"are tending toward depression seek pleasure as an antidote; hence ",
				"insatiable hedonism and excessive sex, with perversions as a",
				"means of getting new kicks. Boredom too tends to cause excessive ",
				"pleasure-seeking since, lacking other goals, people often use",
				"pleasure as a goal. See accompanying diagram.",
				"The foregoing is a simplification. Reality is more complex, and of course,",
				"deprivation with respect to the power process is not",
				"the ONLY cause of the symptoms described. By the way, ",
				"when we mention depression we do not necessarily mean depression",
				"that is severe enough to be treated by a psychiatrist. Often only mild forms",
				"of depression are involved. And when we speak of",
				"goals we do not necessarily mean long-term, thought-out goals.",
				"    For many or most people through much of human history, the",
				"goals of a hand-to-mouth existence (merely providing oneself and one’s",
				"    family with food from day to day) have been quite",
				"sufficient.",
				"7. (Paragraph 52) A partial exception may be made for a few passive, ",
				"inward-looking groups, such as the Amish, which have",
				"little effect on the wider society. Apart from these, some genuine small-scale communities",
				"do exist in America today. For",
				"instance, youth gangs and “cults.” Everyone regards them as dangerous,",
				"and so they are, because the members of these groups",
				"are loyal primarily to one another rather than to the system, ",
				"hence the system cannot control them. Or take the gypsies. The",
				"gypsies commonly get away with theft and fraud because their loyalties",
				"are such that they can always get other gypsies to give",
				"testimony that “proves” their innocence. Obviously the system would be",
				"in serious trouble if too many people belonged to such",
				"groups. Some of the early-20th century Chinese thinkers who were concerned ",
				"with modernizing China recognized the",
				"necessity breaking down small-scale social groups such as the family:",
				"“(According to Sun Yat-sen) the Chinese people needed",
				"a new surge of patriotism, which would lead to a transfer of loyalty ",
				"from the family to the state.... (According to Li Huang)",
				"traditional attachments, particularly to the family had to be abandoned ",
				"if nationalism were to develop in China.” (Chester C.",
				"Tan, “Chinese Political Thought in the Twentieth Century,” page 125, page 297.)",
				"8. (Paragraph 56) Yes, we know that 19th century America had its problems, and serious ones,",
				"but for the sake of brevity we",

				"9. (Paragraph 61) We leave aside the “underclass.” We are speaking of the mainstream.",
				"10. (Paragraph 62) Some social scientists, educators, “mental health” professionals and ",

				"social drives into group 1 by trying to see to it that everyone has a satisfactory social life.",
				"11. (Paragraphs 63, 82) Is the drive for endless material acquisition really an artificial",
				"creation of the advertising and marketing",
				"industry? Certainly there is no innate human drive for material acquisition.",
				"There have been many cultures in which people",
				"have desired little material wealth beyond what was necessary to ",
				"satisfy their basic physical needs (Australian aborigines,",
				"traditional Mexican peasant culture, some African cultures). On the ",
				"other hand there have also been many pre-industrial",
				"cultures in which material acquisition has played an important role",
				". So we can’t claim that today’s acquisition-oriented culture",
				"is exclusively a creation of the advertising and marketing industry.",
				"But it is clear that the advertising and marketing industry",
				"has had an important part in creating that culture. The big corporations",
				"that spend millions on advertising wouldn’t be spending",
				"that kind of money without solid proof that they were getting it back in",
				"increased sales. One member of FC met a sales",
				"manager a couple of years ago who was frank enough to tell him, “Our job",
				"is to make people buy things they don’t want and",
				"don’t need.” He then described how an untrained novice could present ",
				"people with the facts about a product, and make no sales ",
				"at all, while a trained and experienced professional salesman would",
				"make lots of sales to the same people. This shows that",
				"people are manipulated into buying things they don’t really want.",
				"12. (Paragraph 64) The problem of purposelessness seems to have become",
				"less serious during the last 15 years or so, because",
				"people now feel less secure physically and economically than they did earlier, ",
				"and the need for security provides them with a",
				"goal. But purposelessness has been replaced by frustration over the difficulty ",
				"of attaining security. We emphasize the problem",
				"of purposelessness because the liberals and leftists would wish to solve our",
				"social problems by having society guarantee",
				"everyone’s security; but if that could be done it would only bring back",
				"the problem of purposelessness. The real issue is not",
				"whether society provides well or poorly for people’s security; the trouble ",
				"is that people are dependent on the system for their",
				"security rather than having it in their own hands. This, by the way,",
				"is part of the reason why some people get worked up about",
				"the right to bear arms; possession of a gun puts that ",
				"aspect of their security in their own hands.",
				"13. (Paragraph 66) Conservatives’ efforts to decrease the amount of government",
				"regulation are of little benefit to the average",
				"man. For one thing, only a fraction of the regulations can be ",
				"eliminated because most regulations are necessary. For another",
				"thing, most of the deregulation affects business rather than ",
				"the average individual, so that its main effect is to take power from",
				"the government and give it to private corporations. What this",
				"means for the average man is that government interference in his",
				"life is replaced by interference from big corporations, which",
				"may be permitted, for example, to dump more chemicals that get",
				"into his water supply and give him cancer. The conservatives ",
				"are just taking the average man for a sucker, exploiting his",
				"resentment of Big Government to promote the power of Big Business.",
				"14. (Paragraph 73) When someone approves of the purpose for ",
				"which propaganda is being used in a given case, he generally",
				"calls it “education” or applies to it some similar euphemism.",
				"But propaganda is propaganda regardless of the purpose for which",
				"it is used.",
				"15. (Paragraph 83) We are not expressing approval or disapproval ",
				"of the Panama invasion. We only use it to illustrate a point.",

				"movements to the city and to the factory, both just gathering force",

				"closely packed neighborhoods inhibited many actions previously",

				"21. (Paragraph 128) Since many people may find paradoxical ",
				"the notion that a large number of good things can add up to a bad",
				"thing, we illustrate with an analogy. Suppose Mr. A is playing",
				"chess with Mr. B. Mr. C, a Grand Master, is looking over Mr.A’s",

				"23. (Paragraph 137) Self-interest is not necessarily MATERIAL",
				"self-interest. It can consist in fulfillment of some",
				"psychological need, for example, by promoting one’s own ideology or religion.",
				"24. (Paragraph 139) A qualification: It is in the interest of the ",
				"system to permit a certain prescribed degree of freedom in some",
				"areas. For example, economic freedom (with suitable limitations and",
				"    restraints) has proved effective in promoting economic",
				"growth. But only planned, circumscribed, limited freedom is in the ",
				"interest of the system. The individual must always be kept",
				"on a leash, even if the leash is sometimes long (see paragraphs 94, 97).",
				"25. (Paragraph 143) We don’t mean to suggest that the efficiency or the",
				"potential for survival of a society has always been",
				"inversely proportional to the amount of pressure or discomfort to",
				"which the society subjects people. That certainly is not the",

				"subjected people to less pressure than European society did,",
				"but European society proved far more efficient than any primitive",
				"society and always won out in conflicts with such societies",
				"because of the advantages conferred by technology.",
				"26. (Paragraph 147) If you think that more effective law enforcement",
				"is unequivocally good because it suppresses crime, then",
				"remember that crime as defined by the system is not necessarily what",
				"YOU would call crime. Today, smoking marijuana is a",
				"“crime,” and, in some places in the U.S., so is possession of an",
				"unregistered handgun. Tomorrow, possession of ANY firearm,",
				"registered or not, may be made a crime, and the same thing may happen ",
				"with disapproved methods of child-rearing, such as",
				"spanking. In some countries, expression of dissident political opinions ",
				"is a crime, and there is no certainty that this will never",
				"happen in the U.S., since no constitution or political system lasts ",
				"forever. If a society needs a large, powerful law enforcement",
				"establishment, then there is something gravely wrong with that ",

				"many refuse to follow the rules, or follow them only because forced.",
				"Many societies in the past have gotten by with little or no",
				"formal law-enforcement.",

				" His identity is a matter of dispute. Some make him Satan himself, while others take him to be only one of Satan's many evil subordinates.", 
				" However, it is curious that his minions are allowed only to torture and not to kill.", 

				"________________________________________", 

				"Second Temple era texts uses Abaddon 'destruction,' the Hebrew name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon, i.e., destroyer) of 'the angel of the bottomless pit'", 
				" ( Revelation 9:11 ). It is rendered 'destruction' in Job 28:22; 31:12; 26:6; ", 
				" Proverbs 15:11; 27:20 . In the last three of these passages the Revised Version retains the word 'Abaddon.'", 
				" We may regard this word as a personification of the idea of Destruction or as sheol, the realm of the dead.", 

				"Of all the ominous characters described in the book of Revelation, Abaddon—also known as Apollyon—is one of the most menacing", 
				" This demonic being lives up to his name, which means Destruction.", 
				" He arrives on the scene in the Final Days and is introduced as one of Satan's high-ranking officials,",

				" He will be permitted to take those who reject Christ as King during the cleansing of the whole earth to make way for a 'new heaven and a new earth' (Revelation 21:1).'", 

				"What Is the Meaning of Abaddon in the Old Testament?", 

				"In the Old Testament, we catch a glimpse of the word Abaddon in five places—three times in the book of Job (Job 26:6; 28: 22; 12),", 
				" once in the Psalms (Psalms 88:11), and once in Proverbs (Proverbs 15:11).", 
				" Each of these brief occurrences describes Abaddon as a unique place of Destruction associated with the realm of the dead.", 
				"Some biblical researchers believe there are indirect New Testament passages that refer to the locale of Abaddon without specifically naming that place.", 
				" Unlike Sheol, which Scripture characterizes as an intermediate site for unregenerate humanity after Death,", 
				" these researchers believe that Abaddon is a separate realm where fallen angels are incarcerated until God's appointed time of Judgment.", 

				"'And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, ", 
				"bound with everlasting chains for judgment on a great Day' (Jude 1:6).", 

				"'For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;' (2 Peter 2:4).", 

				"Whether or not these researchers have correctly interpreted the fallen angel's prison as Abaddon, one thing is sure according to the Old Testament;", 
				" Abaddon is a supernatural realm set apart for Destruction and those who cause Destruction.", 

				"Who is Abaddon (Apollyon) in the New Testament?", 

				"The New Testament helps us identify the ruler over the realm of Abaddon in Revelation 9. This fallen angel, with the same name as his realm,", 
				" is introduced after the fifth trumpet of Judgment is blown. Those on earth during the Tribulation period witness the horrific events that follow.", 
				" A star falls from Heaven and releases a horde of demonic locust-like creatures from the smoke-filled Abyss. These creatures are then commissioned", 
				" to torture everyone on earth who has received the mark of the Beast (Revelation 9:1-10).", 

				"Abaddon, whose Greek name is Apollyon, is revealed as the angel of the Abyss and the King of the tormenting locusts (Revelation 9:11). It is", 
				" debated whether Abaddon's identity is that of Satan himself. However, we know the fallen angel cannot be Satan because our enemy has not yet", 
				" been sentenced to Hell or any such confined space. Instead, the Bible tells us that Satan currently roams the earth, seeking whom he may devour", 
				" (John 14:30, 1 Peter 5:8, Ephesians 2:2).", 

				"However, according to Revelation 20:1-7, it seems that Satan will eventually be locked and sealed in the realm of Abaddon for a thousand years", 
				" before His final sentence, where he will be cast into the lake of fire once for all.", 

				"'And I saw an angel coming out of Heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, that ancient", 
				" serpent, the Devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him", 
				" from deceiving the nations until the thousand years ended.'", 

				"What Is the Role of Abaddon (Apollyon) during End-Time Events?", 

				"At God's appointed time and His command, Abaddon is the one who fulfills the fifth wave of trumpet judgment that will overtake the earth during", 
				" the Tribulation. He uses his locust subjects as a mass destruction tool to accomplish this purpose.", 

				"These 'locusts' under Abaddon's rule are not the same crop-destroying insects that live in infamy on Earth. 'They are instructed not to bother ", 
				"with the grass or trees [when they are released] but to, instead, swarm against humans. They are given five months in which to torment people", 
				" with pain like that of a scorpion bite. The Bible says it will be such agony that people will long for Death but not be able to find it,' ", 
				" explains Lori Stanley Roeleveld in What Do Locusts Symbolize in the Bible?", 
				"Scripture details the demon locust's horrific appearance and destructive powers. The apostle John—who received the End Times revelation from God,", 
				" then recorded it for Believers throughout the ages", 
				" to read—described the supernatural creatures using vivid language and his limited comparisons when translating the vision.", 
				" However, these demons were likely beyond anything humans can comprehend this side of Heaven.", 

				"John describes the tormenting creatures as 'locusts' with human faces, long flowing hair, ", 
				"and sharp teeth. They were dressed in breastplates of iron and looked like horses prepped for battle. ", 
				"They wore crowns of gold on their heads, and the sound of their wings in flight was a thunderous noise that resembled a team of horses rushing into battle.", 
				" The locusts had the power to torment people for five months, using their scorpion-like tails to sting anyone who bore the mark of the Antichrist. ", 
				" Once stung, a victim would suffer to the point of longing for Death but would be unable to receive the comfort of the grave (Revelation 9:7-10).", 

				"Although Abaddon and his minions inflict unspeakable pain upon unsaved humanity during this period,", 
				" God is still in control. Abaddon will not be permitted to destroy humanity. ", 
				" The role of this fallen angel is defined and ordained by God, and all the other powers of Hell are subject to God's sovereign will.", 

				"Why Should Christians Know About This?", 

				"If those who have not received the mark of the Beast are exempt from the torture involved in the fifth trumpet judgment, ", 
				"why should Believers be concerned with knowing the gory details outlined in Revelation nine?", 

				"'First, we should remember that even if we know Jesus as our personal Savior, many of our friends and family do not. ", 
				"We want to help as many souls as possible to come and know our Savior prior to these events,'", 

				"As time draws to an end, the clock is an ever-present reminder of our duty and honor to lead others to Christ.", 
				" Now more than ever, it is essential that Believers waste no time in presenting the Good News to those around us—especially those we love.", 
				" Their eternal security depends upon it, and Christians have been given this great commission as a way to honor Jesus and reveal His glory to the world at large.", 

				"The tragic events revealed in John's end-times visions are a sobering reminder to believers that Destruction lies ahead", 
				" for anyone who has not placed their hope in Jesus. This should motivate us to shout from the rooftops the Way of salvation.", 

				"Another essential thing to consider when wondering whether the End Times study is critical is that the Bible tells us that God gives all Scripture", 
				" for a purpose. God wants to teach, rebuke, correct, and train believers in righteousness through His Word so that we can be complete and fully equipped", 
				" for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16, 17).", 

				"Scripture tells us that those who read the prophecies in the book of Revelation are blessed. 'Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy,", 
				" and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near' (Revelation 1:3).", 
				" God included the details of the fifth trumpet judgment and every other prophecy in Scripture to give His children ", 
				" an insight into future events and to shine the light of truth on who He is.", 
				"As long as we do not become fixated on and hyper-concerned with setting dates, and over-conceptualizing the End Times according to our limited understanding,", 
				" a healthy study of the book of Revelation will enrich every believer's faith.", 

				"When we take the time to weed through, study, and consider all the complexities of the strange and terrifying last book of the Bible,", 
				" we see that it points back to the redemptive thread woven through the entire fabric of Scripture. God's redemptive work comes into full ", 
				" view in the book of Revelation and completes the circle of mercy and grace that began in Genesis at the fall of man.",

				"Second Temple era texts uses Abaddon 'destruction,' the Hebrew name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon, i.e., destroyer) of 'the angel of the bottomless pit'", 
				" ( Revelation 9:11 ). It is rendered 'destruction' in Job 28:22; 31:12; 26:6; ",

				" We may regard this word as a personification of the idea of Destruction or as sheol, the realm of the dead.", 

				"Of all the ominous characters described in the book of Revelation, Abaddon—also known as Apollyon—is one of the most menacing",

				" He will be permitted to take those who reject Christ as King during the cleansing of the whole earth to make way for a 'new heaven and a new earth' (Revelation 21:1).'", 

				"What Is the Meaning of Abaddon in the Old Testament?", 

				"In the Old Testament, we catch a glimpse of the word Abaddon in five places—three times in the book of Job (Job 26:6; 28: 22; 12),", 
				" once in the Psalms (Psalms 88:11), and once in Proverbs (Proverbs 15:11).", 
				" Each of these brief occurrences describes Abaddon as a unique place of Destruction associated with the realm of the dead.", 
				"Some biblical researchers believe there are indirect New Testament passages that refer to the locale of Abaddon without specifically naming that place.", 
				" Unlike Sheol, which Scripture characterizes as an intermediate site for unregenerate humanity after Death,", 
				" these researchers believe that Abaddon is a separate realm where fallen angels are incarcerated until God's appointed time of Judgment.", 

				"'And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, ", 
				"bound with everlasting chains for judgment on a great Day' (Jude 1:6).", 

				"'For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;' (2 Peter 2:4).", 

				"Whether or not these researchers have correctly interpreted the fallen angel's prison as Abaddon, one thing is sure according to the Old Testament;", 
				" Abaddon is a supernatural realm set apart for Destruction and those who cause Destruction.", 

				"Who is Abaddon (Apollyon) in the New Testament?", 

				"The New Testament helps us identify the ruler over the realm of Abaddon in Revelation 9. This fallen angel, with the same name as his realm,", 
				" is introduced after the fifth trumpet of Judgment is blown. Those on earth during the Tribulation period witness the horrific events that follow.", 
				" A star falls from Heaven and releases a horde of demonic locust-like creatures from the smoke-filled Abyss. These creatures are then commissioned", 
				" to torture everyone on earth who has received the mark of the Beast (Revelation 9:1-10).", 

				"Abaddon, whose Greek name is Apollyon, is revealed as the angel of the Abyss and the King of the tormenting locusts (Revelation 9:11). It is", 
				" debated whether Abaddon's identity is that of Satan himself. However, we know the fallen angel cannot be Satan because our enemy has not yet", 
				" been sentenced to Hell or any such confined space. Instead, the Bible tells us that Satan currently roams the earth, seeking whom he may devour", 
				" (John 14:30, 1 Peter 5:8, Ephesians 2:2).", 

				"However, according to Revelation 20:1-7, it seems that Satan will eventually be locked and sealed in the realm of Abaddon for a thousand years", 
				" before His final sentence, where he will be cast into the lake of fire once for all.", 

				"'And I saw an angel coming out of Heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding a great chain in his hand. He seized the dragon, that ancient", 
				" serpent, the Devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him", 
				" from deceiving the nations until the thousand years ended.'", 

				"What Is the Role of Abaddon (Apollyon) during End-Time Events?", 

				"At God's appointed time and His command, Abaddon is the one who fulfills the fifth wave of trumpet judgment that will overtake the earth during", 
				" the Tribulation. He uses his locust subjects as a mass destruction tool to accomplish this purpose.", 

				"These 'locusts' under Abaddon's rule are not the same crop-destroying insects that live in infamy on Earth. 'They are instructed not to bother ", 
				"with the grass or trees [when they are released] but to, instead, swarm against humans. They are given five months in which to torment people", 
				" with pain like that of a scorpion bite. The Bible says it will be such agony that people will long for Death but not be able to find it,' ", 
				" explains Lori Stanley Roeleveld in What Do Locusts Symbolize in the Bible?", 
				"Scripture details the demon locust's horrific appearance and destructive powers. The apostle John—who received the End Times revelation from God,", 
				" then recorded it for Believers throughout the ages", 
				" to read—described the supernatural creatures using vivid language and his limited comparisons when translating the vision.", 
				" However, these demons were likely beyond anything humans can comprehend this side of Heaven.", 

				"John describes the tormenting creatures as 'locusts' with human faces, long flowing hair, ", 
				"and sharp teeth. They were dressed in breastplates of iron and looked like horses prepped for battle. ", 
				"They wore crowns of gold on their heads, and the sound of their wings in flight was a thunderous noise that resembled a team of horses rushing into battle.", 
				" The locusts had the power to torment people for five months, using their scorpion-like tails to sting anyone who bore the mark of the Antichrist. ", 
				" Once stung, a victim would suffer to the point of longing for Death but would be unable to receive the comfort of the grave (Revelation 9:7-10).", 

				"Although Abaddon and his minions inflict unspeakable pain upon unsaved humanity during this period,", 
				" God is still in control. Abaddon will not be permitted to destroy humanity. ", 
				" The role of this fallen angel is defined and ordained by God, and all the other powers of Hell are subject to God's sovereign will.", 

				"Why Should Christians Know About This?", 

				"If those who have not received the mark of the Beast are exempt from the torture involved in the fifth trumpet judgment, ", 
				"why should Believers be concerned with knowing the gory details outlined in Revelation nine?", 

				"'First, we should remember that even if we know Jesus as our personal Savior, many of our friends and family do not. ", 
				"We want to help as many souls as possible to come and know our Savior prior to these events,'", 

				"As time draws to an end, the clock is an ever-present reminder of our duty and honor to lead others to Christ.", 
				" Now more than ever, it is essential that Believers waste no time in presenting the Good News to those around us—especially those we love.", 
				" Their eternal security depends upon it, and Christians have been given this great commission as a way to honor Jesus and reveal His glory to the world at large.", 

				"The tragic events revealed in John's end-times visions are a sobering reminder to believers that Destruction lies ahead", 
				" for anyone who has not placed their hope in Jesus. This should motivate us to shout from the rooftops the Way of salvation.", 

				"Another essential thing to consider when wondering whether the End Times study is critical is that the Bible tells us that God gives all Scripture", 
				" for a purpose. God wants to teach, rebuke, correct, and train believers in righteousness through His Word so that we can be complete and fully equipped", 
				" for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16, 17).", 

				"Scripture tells us that those who read the prophecies in the book of Revelation are blessed. 'Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy,", 
				" and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near' (Revelation 1:3).", 
				" God included the details of the fifth trumpet judgment and every other prophecy in Scripture to give His children ", 
				" an insight into future events and to shine the light of truth on who He is.", 
				"As long as we do not become fixated on and hyper-concerned with setting dates, and over-conceptualizing the End Times according to our limited understanding,", 
				" a healthy study of the book of Revelation will enrich every believer's faith.", 

				"When we take the time to weed through, study, and consider all the complexities of the strange and terrifying last book of the Bible,", 
				" we see that it points back to the redemptive thread woven through the entire fabric of Scripture. God's redemptive work comes into full ", 
				" view in the book of Revelation and completes the circle of mercy and grace that began in Genesis at the fall of man.",

				"At the end of Genesis, Egypt and Palestine were in the grips of a famine and Joseph had been reunited with his father, ", 
				"Jacob, and his brothers after they came to Egypt to buy food. Joseph invited them to stay with him in Egypt. ", 
				"God used the next 4 centuries to fulfill 3 promises to Abraham and his descendants. The first was that they were to increase in numbers. ", 
				"(Gen. 46:2-4) Egypt was just the kind of place where that could happen. It had a predictable supply of water in the Nile River, ", 
				"a temperate climate and less exposure to invasion than other countries. This provided an environment where Jacob’s descendants could grow significantly. ", 
				"The political climate of Egypt was also favorable as well. Wealth flowed into Egypt from all over the world", 
				" along with craftsmen and traders as Egypt increased it borders in Palestine and Syria and to the south.", 
				" This was a time of benevolent rule and peace. And because of Joseph’s service to Egypt and its ultimate rescue during a great famine,", 
				" his family enjoyed the political favor of Egypt.", 

				"But the second promise fulfilled is that the Israelites would be afflicted. ", 
				"The Scriptures tell us a time came when a new Pharaoh rose to power who had no knowledge of Joseph’s contribution or of his family.", 
				" With its newfound wealth, Egypt began great building projects requiring forced service to complete. ", 
				" The Hebrew people fell under oppression and servitude along with conquered Asiatic people. The Hebrews made mud bricks,", 
				" which was filthy and miserable work and had daily quotas that Egyptian records show slaves rarely met.", 
				" The Hebrew time as Egyptian slaves was unbearable as they were worked “ruthlessly” and their lives were “bitter”", 
				" due to “hard, cruel” service. As a result, Israel languished in “misery” and “suffering” and their spirits were ", 
				" “broken.” And so they cried out to God to deliver them and he heard them and responded. ", 
				" The third promise would happen only when these first two had transpired: the gift of the promised land.", 
				" And what we finb is that all of this happened for a reason and were part of a larger plan.", 

				"In response to the growing threat of the number of Hebrews, Pharaoh demanded the killing of all Hebrew babies.", 
				" But in response to Israel’s cries for help, God saved one child, Moses who grew into a man. ", 
				" Even though he had mishaps and flaws, he was used by God to deliver the Hebrews from slavery. ", 
				" God revealed himself to Moses in a burning bush and charged him to go free His people from slavery. ", 
				" God equipped him for this calling and what followed was an epic showdown between Pharaoh and Moses that included 10 plagues. ", 
				" Pharaoh finally relented after the Passover of the spirit of death over Egypt killing the Egyptians babies.", 
				" The Hebrews were freed and after a dramatic escape, they entered the wilderness where they will travel for 40 years in a kind of spiritual bootcamp as God molded,", 
				" shaped and prepared them for the challenges and calling that lied ahead. At the end of the journey, ", 
				" God gives the Law to teach them the expectations of relationship with him and how they were to live together as one nation.", 

				"The exodus marks the real beginning of the history of Israel as a people and a nation. From this point on, the Bible speaks of a nation unified by God.", 
				" It tells the story of Israel’s continued struggle with sin and obedience. Despite all of this, God chose them for a special role and sticks with them.", 
				" The escape from Egypt is a watershed event in the Hebrew’s people’s life. ", 
				" Yet, we cannot separate this miraculous event from the journey in the wilderness nor the conquest of the promise land or the giving of the Law. ", 
				" These make up the grand story of God’s deliverance. What we find is that these four events together became THE defining event in the life of Israel,", 
				" their understanding of their purpose in life and how they are to live as one people.", 

				"In the great narratives of the Old Testament, the central character is always God and reveals who He is. What do we learn about God in our readings this week? God is all powerful. This is not the first time we have seen the power of God. In Genesis, God is the author of all creation who spoke everything into existence. We see God has the power to destroy through the flood. And we see God has the power to give life by helping a couple who is long past child bearing years overcome their barrenness. We see that God is able to work in spite of the sin of his children and the terrible events that happen to them. Nothing will thwart God from accomplishing His will. But in Exodus the question of God’s power is infinitely challenged. The Hebrew people are now enslaved in the most powerful nation of the world. A lone man, Moses, is enlisted to challenge the Pharaoh of Egypt, who is considered to be a god himself, to free the Hebrew people. What transpires is an epic showdown with the God of Israel and his emissary pitted against the god Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt. Clearly, from the eyes of the world, all of Egypt and maybe even some of the Hebrews, Moses was outmanned and outgunned. But time and again, God’s proves his power through each plague, the Passover, the parting of the waters of the Red Sea and even the journey in the wilderness as he provides water and manna. James Martin writes, “In reality, the Lord’s route was designed to get Israel out of Egypt and away from Egyptian control in such a way that only he, the Lord Almighty would be recognized as deliverer of the Hebrew people.” The Lord’s promise was done in such a way that the reputation of the God of Israel spread to the surrounding nations. For centuries to come, the nations of the world feared the God of Israel and no one doubted His power.", 
				"The second thing we learn is that God never just delivers us from something, God always delivers us for something. In other words, ", 
				"we are saved for a purpose. At the burning bush, God reveals himself by announcing His name and His plan. Remember, God is what God does. ", 
				"God’s name Yahweh comes from the root of the verb “to be” and essentially relates to the concept of being and the idea of one who brings others into being. ", 
				"Moses, a murderer in exile is chosen by God to become His spokesperson and deliverer of the Hebrew people. ", 
				"But as the biblical text expands its focus from individuals to a people, ", 
				"we see God calls these Hebrew slaves into being not only as a free people but to be His chosen people, ", 
				"a light unto the nations calling all people into relationship with the one true God. From this point on, ", 
				"they are, to quote the Blue’s Brothers, “on a mission from God.” This would define their purpose and their life with God and others from this day on.", 

				"Fast forward 3500 years from the time of Moses. ", 
				"I am on a tour bus which is climbing some 4000 feet over 20 miles on the highway from Jericho to Jerusalem and struggling to maintain its speed.", 
				" Everyone on the bus is exhausted from the time in the desert and wilderness around the Dead Sea. ", 
				" I took the opportunity to walk up to the front of the bus and sit next to our tour guide, Julie Baretz, ", 
				" a New Yorker who has married an Israeli and become an Israeli citizen.", 
				" I began to ask her about the Jew’s understanding of God’s call upon their life as a nation. ", 
				" She shares that roughly 90% of Israeli’s are not practicing Jews as the nation has become more and more secular. ", 
				" I then ask her about God’s call to be a light unto the nations. Would she say that the Jews and Israel are living up to that calling? And she answers,", 
				" “That’s really not the way we look at ourselves. ", 
				" You have to understand that every day is about just surviving when you are surrounded by nations that want to destroy you.”", 
				" She then politely asks me about the Great Commission and how Christians are doing with that. ", 
				" And I explain not so well and that in our Methodist tradition the average person brings one person to Christ their entire lifetime.", 
				" Yet we’re called to make disciples of Jesus Christ. God never just delivers us from something, but always delivers us for something.", 
				" So what about you? How are you participating in God’s plan of salvation? Are you being salt and light to the world? Who have you brought to faith in Jesus?", 

				"Third, God' has covenanted with the Israelites. The first part of the book of Exodus tells the story of Moses’", 
				" struggle against Pharaoh to free the Hebrews and the dangerous escape and journey to Mount Sinai. It is here that God made a covenant with Israel.", 
				" This is not only the central event of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, but also in Israel’s life and relationship with God.", 
				" The covenant is constantly referred to throughout the Old Testament from Joshua to the prophets, Amos, Hosea, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.", 
				" Central to the covenant is the giving of the Law which shapes the story of Israel, it’s understanding of itself and its relationship to God.", 
				" It serves as the standard for judging Israel’s success or failure, obedience or rebellion and sin as well as that of Israel’s kings.", 
				" The covenant shapes how Israel interpreted their entire story in light of its fidelity to the covenant and thus God.", 
				"It is in this covenant that God profoundly tells Israel, “I will be your God and you will be my people.” God has chosen the Israelites.", 
				" From this perspective, the covenant is unconditional and nothing can break it. God has bound himself in relationship to Israel.", 
				" God promises to be its protector and helper, not only against foreign enemies but against sickness, disease and chaos. ", 
				" Most of all, God promises to be present in good times and bad and in time of obedience and times of sin and rebellion for he has laid claim to this people as His own.", 
				" The Law is a detailed explanation of what God expects of Israel in this relationship.", 
				" And if Israel is obedient, then God will bless them,", 
				" but if they disobey, then God will punish them. The Mosaic Covenant is especially significant because in it God promises to make Israel ", 
				" “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” Israel is to be God’s light to the dark world around them.", 
				" They were to be a separate and called-out nation so that everyone around them would know that they worshiped Yahweh.", 

				"This unifies the Hebrews into the nation of Israel, based not on blood but instead on submission to the divine will and the confession that He alone is God. ", 
				"It clarified and formalized God’s relationship to Israel. The richest expression of what the covenant with God meant to Israel is found in Exodus 34:6-7,", 
				" “The Lord, (is a) the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness,", 
				" rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished;", 
				" he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”", 

				"For hundreds of years, suffered in captivity and they were literally dying in their faith.", 
				" But it was the hand of God that reached out and delivered them from from captivity and death to new life, ", 
				" a relationship with Him and a new purpose. In the Exodus and God’s deliverance, they knew they were taken from death ", 
				" and not just given life but life but life with a purpose. God literally saved the Hebrews for a great work. ", 
				" They were no one and now they were someone. They were saved for life and the invitation to be God’s light in the darkness in the world around them. ", 
				" They were to be a separate and called-out nation so that everyone around them would come to worshiped God ",

				"What about you? Do you realized that you have not just been saved but saved for a special relationship with God so that you might have a special mission ", 
				"to participate in God’s plan of salvation for all people? Jesus died for you not so that you would live but so that might have abundant", 
				" life in him through His mission in the world. Bob Goff closes with, “Accepting an invitation to show up in life is about moving from the bleachers ", 
				" (or pews) to the field….It’s about having things matter to us so that we stop thinking about those things and start doing something about them.", 
				" Simply put, Jesus is looking for us to accept the invitation to particicpate…When we accept life’s invitation, its contagious too.", 
				" Other people will watch us and start seeing life as more amazing, more whimsical than before. When you show up to the big life, the people,", 
				" the type who don’t think they’re invited start seeing invitations everywhere… They don’t think about their pain or weakness any longer.", 
				" Instead they think about how incredible a big life really is and how powerful the one who is (inviting is)…Jesus wants us to come….", 
				" The one who is inviting you is way more powerful than any of the impediments we think we’re facing and He has just one message for us.",

				"That is probably why no one ever speaks about their temptations—we are ashamed of them.", 

				"But the Bible clearly states that temptations are not a sin. Hebrews 4:15 contains that startling information:", 

				"Jesus was tempted in all points like we are, but He never sinned! If temptations were a sin, ", 
				"Jesus sinned because He was tempted just like us. However, the Bible clearly states that Jesus was sinless ", 
				"(2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 John 3:5). Therefore, temptations cannot be a sin or anything to be ashamed of.", 

				"2. Every single human being experiences temptations.", 

				"No one escapes the onslaught of temptations. Not a single person. Hebrews 4:15 reveals that everyone is tempted:", 
				"  But was in all points tempted as we are.  Did you see the words  as we are  without any exceptions or limitations? ", 
				" You are tempted; she is tempted; he is tempted; they are tempted; I am tempted.", 

				"3. Temptations come to everyone, no matter how godly.", 

				"Far too many of us are tragically misinformed about the truth of temptations. People assume that the more godly a person becomes,", 
				" the fewer temptations that person will face. Nevertheless, the godliest of all humans who ever lived, Jesus Christ, ", 
				" was  tempted as we are  at all points! Godliness does not in any way limit the number of temptations we may receive.", 
				" Jesus was not just tempted a little bit in  all  ways. Shocking, isn't it?", 

				"4. Temptations are typical, God-given desires that seek to trespass God's boundaries.", 

				"What exactly are temptations? ", 
				"The answer may surprise you because temptations are based on the typical desires God gave to all of us but with one thing out of place:", 
				" Those desires seek to trespass the boundaries God established for us.", 

				"In other words, the temptation is simply a good desire gone bad!", 

				"Our God-given desires become temptations when we desire too much, go too far,", 
				" or seek to fulfill them in the wrong place or with the wrong person. ", 
				" Temptations are simply the inner push of our typical desires to overstep God's boundaries. ", 
				" Often the Bible calls our sins a trespass, which means to go beyond a clear boundary into the forbidden or off-limits territory.", 

				"5. Temptations precede every sin; if you overcome temptations, you will not sin.", 

				"Every sin you have ever committed or will commit is always—and I always mean—preceded by a temptation!", 
				" If you are not tempted, guess what? You will not sin!", 

				"It would help if you embraced this all-important fact: Temptations precede every sin.", 

				"With that in mind, look at how Hebrews 4:15 connects temptations and sin:  But was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. ", 

				"Jesus was tempted, but He did not permit the desires He felt to find inappropriate fulfillment in any selfish or sinful act. This means Jesus felt the desire, just like all of us do; He chose not to allow those desires to give birth to sin.", 

				"Perhaps the great overlooked secret of overcoming sin in your life is to focus on defeating the temptations you face and not so much on defeating the sins that result from your choice to give in to your temptations! Here are the three stages working in every temptation: Desire ?Temptation ?Sin", 

				"If you tone down the intensity of your wrongful desire, then temptations flee into the darkness, powerless and defeated. ", 
				"When you defeat a temptation, ", 
				"you no longer have to struggle with that particular desire to sin because you exercised your self-discipline and said no to that straying desi", 

				"The temptation to sin is something we all face as Christians, no matter how long we have followed Christ.", 
				" However, there are practical things we can do to grow stronger and wiser in our struggle against sin. ", 
				" Overcoming temptation can be accomplished by sticking to five biblical practices.", 

				"More Tips for Overcoming Temptation", 

				"1. Pray when you feel tempted.", 

				"2. Read the Bible when you feel tempted.", 

				"3. Find a Christian friend you can call when you feel tempted.", 

				"Recognize Your Tendency to Sin", 

				"James 1:14 explains that we are tempted when we become enticed by our natural desires.", 
				" The first step toward overcoming temptation is recognizing the human tendency to be seduced by our fleshly cravings.", 

				"The temptation to sin is a given, so do not be surprised. Please expect to be tempted daily,", 
				" and be prepared for it. The apostle Peter reminds us to stay on the lookout:", 

				"Be alert and of a sober mind. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. (1 Peter 5:8, NIV)", 

				"Flee From Temptation", 

				"The New Living Translation of 1 Corinthians 10:13 is easy to understand and apply:", 

				"However, remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience.", 
				" Moreover, God is faithful.", 
				" He will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you cannot stand up against it. When you are tempted,", 
				" he will show you a way out so that you will not give in to it.", 

				"When you come face to face with temptation, look for the way out—the way of escape—that God has promised. Run as fast as you can. Then skedaddle. Flee.", 

				"Resist Temptation With the Word of Truth", 

				"Hebrews 4:12 says God's Word is living, active, and influential. Did you know you can carry a weapon to make your thoughts obey Jesus Christ?", 

				"According to Ephesians 6:17, one of our weapons is the Word of God:", 

				"The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have the divine power to demolish strongholds.", 
				" We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God,", 
				" and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. (2 Corinthians 10:4–5, NIV)", 
				"Jesus overcame the devil's temptations in the wilderness with the Word of God. If it worked for him,", 
				" it would work for us. Moreover, because Jesus was fully human, he can identify with our struggles and give us the exact help we need to overcome temptation.", 

				"While it can be helpful to read God's Word when you are tempted, sometimes that is not practical.", 
				" Even better is to practice reading the Bible daily so that you eventually have so much of it on the inside that you are ready whenever temptation strikes.", 

				"If you read the Bible regularly, you will have the whole counsel of God at your disposal. ", 
				"You will start to have the mind of Christ. When temptation comes knocking on your door, all you will have to do is draw your weapon, aim, and fire.", 

				"Refocus Your Mind and Heart With Praise", 

				"How often have you been tempted to sin when your whole heart was entirely concentrated on worshiping the Lord? I am guessing your answer is never.", 

				"Praising God takes our focus off of self and puts it on, God. You may not be strong enough to resist temptation on your own,", 
				" but as you focus on God, he will inhabit your praises. He will give you the strength to resist and walk away from temptation.", 

				"Psalm 147 might be an excellent place to start:", 

				"Praise the Lord. How good it is to sing praises to our God. How pleasant and fitting to praise him! (Psalm 147:1, NIV)", 

				"Repent Quickly When You Fail", 

				"In several places, the Bible tells us the best way to resist and overcome temptation is to flee from it ", 
				"(1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Corinthians 10:14; 1 Timothy 6:11; 2 Timothy 2:22). Even still, we fall from time to time.", 
				" Eventually, we will give in and fall when we fail to flee temptation.", 

				"A more realistic view—knowing that, at times, you will fail—should help you to repent quickly. Failing is not the end of the world,", 
				" but it is dangerous to persist in your sin.", 

				"Returning to the book of James, verse 1:15 explains that sin  when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. ", 
				" It is best to repent quickly when you know you have fallen into sin. Continuing or persisting in sin leads to spiritual death and, often, physical death.", 

				"We all face the temptation to sin as Christians, no matter how long we have followed Christ. However,",

				"King Solomon's Accomplishments", 

				"Solomon established an organized state in Israel, with many officials assisting him. ", 
				"The country was divided into 12 central districts, each providing for the king's court for one month each year.", 
				" The system was fair and just, distributing the tax burden evenly throughout the country.", 

				"Solomon built the first temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem,", 
				" a seven-year task that became one of the wonders of the ancient world. ", 
				" He also built a majestic palace, gardens, roads, and government buildings. ", 
				" He accumulated thousands of horses and chariots. After securing peace with his neighbors, ", 
				" he built up trade and became the wealthiest king of his time.", 

				"The Queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame and visited him to test his wisdom with hard questions. ", 
				"After seeing with her own eyes all that Solomon had built in Jerusalem and hearing his wisdom, the queen blessed the God of Israel, saying:", 

				" The report was true that I heard in my land of your words and your wisdom, ", 
				"but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it.", 
				" Furthermore, behold, the half was not told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.  (1 Kings 10:6-7, ESV)", 

				"Solomon, a prolific writer, poet, and scientist, is credited with writing much of the book of Proverbs,", 
				" the Song of Solomon, the book of Ecclesiastes, and two psalms. First Kings 4:32 tells us he wrote 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs.", 

				"Strengths", 

				"King Solomon's greatest strength was his unsurpassed wisdom, granted to him by God. In one biblical episode,", 
				" two women came to him with a dispute. Both lived in the same house and had recently delivered newborns, ", 
				" but one of the infants had died. The dead baby's mother tried to take the living child from the other mother.", 
				" Because no other witnesses lived in the house, the women were left to dispute whom the living child belonged to and who was the true mother.", 
				" Both claimed to have given birth to the baby.", 

				"They asked Solomon to determine which of the two of them should keep the newborn. With great wisdom, ", 
				"Solomon suggested that the boy be cut in half with a sword and split between the two women. Deeply moved by love for her son,", 
				" the first woman whose baby was alive said to the king,  Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Do not kill him! ", 

				"Solomon ruled that the first woman was the real mother because she preferred giving up her child to seeing him harmed. However,", 
				" the other woman said,  Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two! ", 

				"King Solomon's skills in architecture and management turned Israel into the showplace of the Middle East. As a diplomat,", 
				" he made treaties and alliances that brought peace to his kingdom.", 

				"Weaknesses", 

				"To satisfy his curious mind, Solomon turned to worldly pleasures instead of the pursuit of God. He collected all sorts of treasures and surrounded himself with luxury.", 

				"In the case of his non-Jewish wives and concubines, Solomon allowed lust to rule his heart instead of obedience to God.", 
				" He let his foreign wives worship their native gods and even had altars to those gods built in Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:7–8).", 

				"Solomon taxed his subjects heavily and conscripted them into his army and slave-like labor for his building projects.", 

				"Life Lessons", 

				"King Solomon's sins speak loudly to us in today's materialistic culture. ", 
				"We are headed for a fall when we worship possessions and fame over God. ", 
				"When Christians marry an unbeliever, they can also expect trouble. God should be our first love, and we should let nothing come before him.", 

				"Hometown", 

				"Solomon hails from Jerusalem.", 

				"References to King Solomon in the Bible", 

				"2 Samuel 12:24 - 1 Kings 11:43; 1 Chronicles 28, 29; 2 Chronicles 1-10; Nehemiah 13:26; Psalm 72; Matthew 6:29, 12:42.", 

				"Family Tree", 

				"Father: King David", 

				"Mother – Bathsheba", 

				"Brothers - Absalom, Adonijah", 

				"Sister – Tamar", 

				"Son - Rehoboam", 

				"Key Verse", 

				"Nehemiah 13:26  Was it not because of such marriages that Solomon,", 
				" king of Israel, sinned? Among the many nations, there was no king like him. ", 
				" His God loved and made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.  (NIV)",

				"If I didn’t know better I would think this was a description of a service in the modern-day Pentecostal Church!!",
				"And this is just one of the many readings that I could bring to you that depict the exuberance,",
				"excitement and power of early-Army worship.",

				"So, what happened??? When did the Fire go out? HAS the Fire gone out?",

				"Recently I was challenged for being too ‘traditional’ Army. I must admit that I do like the old songs,",
				"though I like new songs too. I do respect the legacy that our forefathers left us,",
				"but I am conscious that we are adding our own legacy to that today as well.",
				"I affirm the Army’s uniqueness within the Christian Church and I uphold our distinctiveness and culture",
				"- because I believe it was raised up by God for a purpose......",

				"The truth is however – the only thing I REALLY want to recapture from the Army’s past is this living, energetic,",
				"electrifying, FREE, Holy Spirit-filled kind of worship!!!",

				"2 Corinthians 3:17 says, “...where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom”",

				"Is there freedom in this place this morning? Are we free to worship God as the Spirit directs us?",
				"Or are we bound by our finely choreographed script!",
				"Are we bound by our man-made rules and expectations as to how worship should be?",
				"Are some of us even bound by our very own tradition?",

				"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom......",

				"Just as electricity permeates every cell,",
				"just as electricity powers every function in our bodies",
				"– so the Holy Spirit permeates every Christian and empowers the Church – the body of Christ to function.",

				"So......What else do we know about this Holy Spirit?",
				"What else can we ask of Him or claim from him - for ourselves as individuals and for us as the Church?",

				"The Holy Spirit is a holy fire – He is the fire in the burning bush from which Moses was called.",
				"He’s the pillar of fire that led the Israelites through the wilderness.",
				"He is the tongues of fire that rested on the heads of the believers on the day of Pentecost.",
				"He is the fire that burns in our own souls when we’re convicted of sin and wrong.",
				"He is the fire and empowers us to witness to others about the greatness of our God.",
				"He is the power that enables us to say, “Jes##s is Lord”",

				"The Holy Spirit is a creative, life-giving force.",
				"He was the force that moved upon the face of the deep at the dawn of creation.",
				"He was the force that made man a living soul. Romans 8:11",
				"tells us that it was the Spirit that raised Jes##s from the dead and it is the Spirit who gave birth to the church.",

				"The Holy Spirit is a mighty rushing wind;-",
				"The wind that blew over the Red sea,",
				"partings it’s waters so the Israelites could cross over.",
				"He is the wind that blew over a valley of dry bones in Ezekiel’s vision,",
				"bringing them to life. He is the wind of Pentecost that blew a bit of umph into the frightened and weak disciples",
				"– Oh that he would blow a bit of umph into us today!!!",

				"He is the Comforter & the promise of Christ.",
				"In our scripture reading today Jes##s Himself promised us the Holy Spirit as a comforter,",

				"All of this, and more, is what we can claim for ourselves today.",

				"This morning I suggest to you that maybe the fire of the Holy Spirit represents Christ’s mission more than any other symbol.",

				"Most people associate Christianity with the cross,",
				"but I suggest to you that it is really the fire that exemplifies Christ’s mission.",
				"Christ’s mission was to enable GOD TO LIVE IN US!! The cross represents the death and punishment,",
				"but the fire represents the life, power and victory. The Fire represents GOD IN US!!!",

				"In Matthew 3:11 John the B#pt#st said about Jes##s: “I baptize you with water for repentance.",
				"But He that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry.",
				"He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.”",

				"Christ died so that we could be forgiven and cleansed, so that we could be holy ",
				"– so that we could become the very dwelling place of God’s Holy Spirit – so that we could be the very Temple of the Living God.",

				"It is interesting to note that when the Holy Spirit came upon Christ, the one who is pure and holy,",
				"the Spirit descended in the form of a gentle dove.",

				"When the Spirit fell upon sinful human beings, however",
				"- he came as a blazing fire – To burn up every trace of sin, to let the light of Glory in,",

				"I recently read this,",

				"“After Christ “baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire”",
				"we must continue to pray for more fire so that the altar continues to blaze for the glory of God.",
				"There is only one baptism, but a continual filling. The more He fills us; the more He breaks us;",
				"the more He sets His fire upon us; the more we become like Him.",

				"An altar without fire is a temple without God. The fireless altar signifies a ruined temple.",
				"We must allow the fire to continue its work in us. We must preach with fire, pray with fire,",
				"and worship with fire. For fifty days after Christ ascended to the right hand of the Father there were no conversions.",
				"Then during Pentecost, which is the Jewish feast of harvest, the fire came and 3,000 people were transformed into believers.",
				"That is the power of the Holy Spirit fire.”",

				"That’s the Power of Holy Spirit Fire this morning.",

				"May we be like the bush that burned with the glory of God but was not consumed.",

				"May we be like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego who went into the furnace but was not even singed.",

				"May we be like gold and silver whose quality improved by continual refining in the fire.",

				"May we Blaze, but not be burned - May we be fireproof. May we be like the deep things of God",
				"- which are brought closer to Him by His refining fire.",

				"May we quench not the Spirit - or suppress his His power within us.",
				"May each of us here today yield to the Holy Spirit and do as the Lord commands,",
				"May he make us Holy, just as he Himself is Holy.”",

				"The Holy Spirit has an incredible purpose in the life of every believer.",
				"He reveals Christ to us - and through us to others. He gives us power.",
				"He teaches us to pray - and He prays for us. He searches our heart and convicts us of sin.",
				"He brings to our attention the scriptures and their meaning-at just the right time of need.",
				"He is the Master of the house, which is our body. He baptizes us. He enables us to be faithful and to serve boldly.",

				"Is it any wonder our Founder would write-Tis fire we want, for fire we plead. Send the fire.",
				"The fire will meet our every need.....We want another Pentecost, Send the fire today!!!",

				"Is that your prayer this morning- that God would send His fire into your heart and life.",

				"To fill you with passion and compassion for him and those around you?",

				"How do we rise above the lure of the world?",
				"Jes##s touches on the essential resources for living in a hostile world all through his final moments with his followers.",

				"1. Develop a settled realization of the depth of God’s love.",

				"2. Deepen your understanding of His word (My words abide in you)",

				"3. Live in unity with and love for other followers.",
				"4. Wait for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who guides and empowers.",

				"We spent two sessions on the ministry of the Holy Spirit.",
				"For a moment look at the particular aspecs of His ministry emphasized by Jes##s.",

				"• He will encourage as Jes##s encouraged. (14:16)",

				"• He will be with us and in us forever. (14:16-17)",

				"• He will teach us all things and bring them to our remembrance (16:26)",

				"• He will bear witness of Jes##s (15:27)",

				"• He will convict the world of sin, righteousness and judgment (16:7-11)",

				"He will guide into all truth by disclosing truth from the Father. (16:13-15)",

				"The key to survival in a hostile world emphasized by Jes##s just before his departure.",

				"• Know his love.",

				"• Know his word.",

				"• Walk in love for one another",

				"• Walk by the Holy Spirit",

				"There is one more element of vital importance to add. Perhaps the most important.",

				"5. Keep in constant communication with the Father",

				"In reality, this may be the most important factor to not just survive, but also thrive, in a hostile fallen world.",

				"I. Examine the passages",

				"Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14:13",

				"If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it. 14:14",

				"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. My Father is glorified by this,",
				"that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples. John 15:7-8",

				"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain,",
				"so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. John 15:16",

				"In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name,",
				"He will give it to you. 16:23",

				"Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full. 16:24",

				"In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;",
				"for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from the Father. John 16:26-27",

				"Repetition indicates importance. The Bible does not needlessly waste space. If there is repetition it is for an important reason.",
				"Here Jes##s repeats the instruction and promise regarding talking to the Father seven times in this brief period of time",
				"before He takes on the sin of the world. Let’s spend a brief moment on the key elements in these passages.",

				"A. Our Part",

				"“ask”",

				"To make an impassioned request. It communicates the idea of a strong desire for something leading one to make a strong request.",
				"The term was used mainly by a subordinate to a superior. Creature to creator. Slave to master. Child to parent.",

				"Jes##s encourages us to ask the Father. He urges us to petition the Father for our every need.",
				"James indicates that the resin we do not have is because we do not ask James 4:2",

				"B. Qualifiers",

				"• “ask in my name”",

				"What does this phrase really mean? It goes deeper than punctuating our prayers with “in Jes##s name amen!”",
				"It has more to do with relationship than rhetoric. Asking in someone’s name assumes a special relationship with that person.",
				"Try asking for access to the white house in the name of Bill Clinton.",
				"The first thing they will require is proof that you have some sort of relationship.",

				"To go to the Father with a request in Jes##s name assumes several things.",

				"1 – I have a personal relationship with Jes##s and he with me.",

				"2—He has authorized me to use his name.",

				"We may have a personal relationship but that doesn’t mean that you have been authorized to sign my checks.",

				"3—It assumes that what I am asking is on behalf of Jes##s and in harmony with his desires.",

				"The sons of Sceva in Acts 19 confronted demonic powers using Jes##s name and Paul’s name.",
				"They knew the right words but had no personal relationship with the person.",
				"The demons felt no compulsion from the Father to obey them.",
				"In fact they found themselves left to their own power and lost the confrontation.",
				"It is important that when we come to the Father as Jes##s encouraged,",
				"anything we ask be requested on behalf of and in harmony with Jes##s whose name we claim to embrace.",

				"When I go to purchase something on behalf of Chico Alliance Church,",
				"I must be certain that I am asking for benefits the church and is in harmony with the wishes of the church.",
				"John repeats this marvelous promise in his letter to the church with a similar qualifier.",

				"“If we ask anything according to his will…”",

				"• “abide in my Jes##s and his words abide in us”",

				"The only other qualification from these verses is that we have a vital connection to Jes##s",
				"and that his will and desires are ingrained in our heart.",

				"Other passages connected to asking add some other qualifiers.",

				"• Don’t use meaningless repetition supposing that you will be heard just because of your many words. Matt 6:7-8",

				"• Don’t ask with wrong motives so that you may sped I on your pleasures James 4:2-3",

				"• Ask in faith without any doubting. James 1:6",

				"Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them,",
				"and they will be granted you. Mark 11:24",

				"• Ask with a pure heart and a clear conscience 1 John 3:21-22",

				"James 5 talks about the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishing much.",

				"• Be persistent",

				"Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart, Luke 18:1",

				"C. Extent",

				"Jes##s offers a broad range of requests.",

				"• “Anything” / “whatever”",

				"Of course one must take into consideration the qualifiers above but that still leaves room for a broad range of petitions.",
				"Anything or whatever is for the benefit of the kingdom and is in harmony with the character and purposes of Jes##s is fair game.",
				"In fact, Paul clearly indicates the extensive nature of our petitions to the Father right after a powerful petition of his own.",

				"Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,",
				" to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jes##s to all generations forever and ever. Amen. Eph 3:20-21",

				"D. Motivation / Purpose",

				"• “that the Father may be glorified in the Son”",

				"• “that we should receive fullness of joy”",

				"• “that we might produce much fruit and prove to be His genuine disciples”",

				"• “to demonstrate the Father’s love for us”",

				"E. God’s Part",

				"• “will do it”",

				"• “It will be given”",

				"When we ask, God promises to respond. We have an opportunity to partner with God.",

				"II. Draw on some similar passages from the New Testament",

				"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. ",
				"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.",
				"Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? ",
				"Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? If you then, being evil,",
				" know how to give good gifts to your children,",
				" how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him! Matthew 7:7-11",

				"And Jes##s answered and said to them, ",
				"Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree,",
				"but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. ",
				"And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive. Matthew 21:21-22",

				"Why is it that we don’t see answers to our prayers?",

				"At times we feel compelled to make up some excuse for unanswered prayer.",

				"III. Consider the application of such a promise today.",

				"Does this apply to us?",

				"Is this instruction and promise only for the original disciples?",

				"Differentiating between descriptive and prescriptive Scripture has to do with how many times it is repeated and to whom.",

				"The early Church devoted themselves to prayer and saw God move mightily among them.",

				"They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship,",
				"to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Acts 2:42",

				"The first elders committed to devote themselves to prayer.",

				"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word. Acts 6:4",

				"Paul instructed the church to devote themselves to prayer.",

				"Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving; Col. 4:2",

				"Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer,",
				"and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 1 Cor. 7:5",

				"With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view,",
				"be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, Ephes. 6:18",

				"The only true application we can conclude is prayer. I light of this most powerful promise of Jes##s,",
				"when we stand with Him in glory, looking back on life’s finished story,",
				"the most amazing feature of that life as it is looked back upon will be its prayerlessness.",
				"The King of kings most clearly invites to the throne room to ask Him to intervene in the affairs of men.",

				"Why is it that we have lost the incentive to spend time in prayer.",

				"IV. Reflect on why we have lost the incentive to pray",

				"A. We are undisciplined for lack of practice.",

				"When Jes##s asked the disciples to pray just for an hour he found them asleep.",

				"He acknowledged that their spirit was willing but their flesh was week.",
				"Yet later we find them in long periods of prayer and after Pentecost we find that prayer was their priority.",
				"Jes##s spent much time in prayer. Paul prayed continually for those he served.",
				"Prayer is a discipline that needs practice and cultivation.",
				"James says we don’t have because we don’t ask or ask with wrong motives.",
				"Paul told the Philippians to stop worrying and keep praying. Don’t worry about anything but pray about everything.",

				"B. We are unmotivated for lack of results",

				"Many cannot even point to one unquestionable answer to prayer.",

				"Some because their prayers have not been specific enough to know when God answers.",

				"“Lord, bless the missionaries!”",

				"“Lord, be with us today!”",

				"There is nothing like answers to prayer to spur us on to greater prayer.",

				"I have grown up in prayer meetings. I have listened to the saints pray my whole life.",
				"I can’t say I have always been impressed.",
				"Many have lost the heart to really pray and lay hold of the throne with passion and humility.",
				"Instead many gather together simply to rehearse their theology, demonstrate their mastery of the English language,",
				"find out or pass on theirs or someone else’s latest aches, pains and troubles.",


				"arlier we touched on some qualifiers.",
				"One of those is to pray in Jes##s name on his behalf and according to his will.",
				"We have lost the passion to pray for what he wants in our church and personal lives.",
				"I would venture to say that Jes##s is much more interested in the development of a passion",
				"for Him than the healing of physical malady. He is much more interested in holiness than happiness.",
				"He seeks obedience more than reliving discomfort.",

				"Why is it that we don’t see more clear answers to prayer?",

				"There are some things the Bible says blocks answers to prayer.",

				"• Poor attitudes of pride and ungratefulness",

				"• Selfish motives more interested in my gain than God’s glory",

				"• Unconfessed sin",

				"• Indifference to the Word of God",

				"• Indifference to the needs around us",

				"• Broken relationships",

				"• Requests that are outside the revealed will of God.",

				"• Doubt",

				"• Haphazard or lackadaisical prayer",

				"• Requests in the power of the flesh rather than in the Spirit",

				"There are also some Divine reasons for unanswered prayer that should not be overlooked.",

				"• Answer may be delayed for a better deal or plan",

				"Zacariah, Israel in bondage, Lazarus",

				"• Request may be outside the ultimate plan of God",

				"Abba, Father,",
				"he said,",
				"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will. Mar 14:36",

				"• Request denied due to a higher priority and purpose",

				"Paul’s thorn in the flesh remained to obtain a higher purpose",

				"• Delay due to demonic interference (Daniel 10)",

				"• Request denied or delayed to build faith and maturity",

				"W may not be ready to handle the answer yet.",
				"There is some maturity to develop before the answer to our prayer can be properly received.",

				"• Avoid entanglements",

				"God may deny or delay one request in order to answer a previous request.",

				"V. Resolve to return to prayer",

				"Oh that we would adopt the attitude of Samuel in regard to our prayer for one another.",

				"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you…1 Samuel 12:23",

				"How can we do it?",

				"I sometimes feel helpless in motivating you toward increased effective prayer as a group or a person.",
				"I myself have become unmotivated to intercede as I feel I should.",

				"All across America today the life-changing prayer meeting has become a thing of the past.",

				"I committed to a prayer time here where at times it was only myself and other times a joined by a only a few others.",
				"I have accommodated schedules and tried to schedule convenient times to gather for prayer.",
				"I have sought to plan extended periods of prayer.",

				"Those who have come found it to be beneficial.",

				"I have sent out prayer samples and intercessory guides to help facilitate prayer.",
				"We have had prayer vigils that have filled up quickly.",
				"I felt that God promised some time ago that we would experience significant growth if we would commit ourselves to the basics.",

				"Teaching, fellowship, communion, prayer.",

				"I must admit it has in recent times not really been a priority for the pastor.",
				"I am not sure it is a priority among our elders as a group. It does not appear to be a priority for the congregation as a whole.",
				"I in no way want to discourage those who faithfully uphold this family in prayer.",
				"The only reason we continue is the faithful prayers of the committed prayer warriors.",
				"Personal prayer is great but it seems to me that when God moved in some most significant ways it was the result",
				"of and even in the midst of a family gathered for prayer.",

				"Every time I hear of those churches with a 6:00am men’s prayer meeting… ",
				"When I read of a church in New York where their Tuesday night prayer time draws over 1,000 people…",

				"I feel guilty and I envious at the same time.",

				"Honestly I don’t know how to bring about the needed change and motivate us to more effective intercession.",
				"All I can do is commit to a more diligent prayer life myself starting today.",
				" It is so easy to let our focus shift from what is important.",
				" We talk about how important pray is to our church and personal life. Only our walk validates our talk.",

				"If we would see growth either in numbers or maturity we must increase and intensify our prayer together.",
				"What should we pray? What is God’s will for Chico? Next week we will join Jes##s in prayer to his father.",
				"This is the real “Lord’s Prayer”. It is the longest example of a prayer of Jes##s.",

				"What did he pray about?",
				"What clues may we get for our prayers for one another?",

				"What lifestyle changes can I make to make room for more prayer?"

				"So the gospel is a good message; it is a declaration of good news.",
				"Why is that so important; because Satan has convinced a lot of people that it is really bad news?",
				"If the world really thought the gospel is good news, they would fill up the churches today. They would be knocking doors down to get in.",
				"They would tear the roof off if necessary to hear message. But “god of this world” blinded to truth.",
				"iii Instead they have been convinced by the devil that our message, the biblical message, is bad news.",
				"It stops good time. It restricts activities and reduces their pleasure. It binds them up with rules and regulations they don’t want.",
				"So there is an upfront prejudice against message because of these preconceived ideas.",
				"The devil has also taken advantage of religious teaching that simply gave people rules and regulations and gave them nothing more.",
				"But according to Galatians (1:6-9) that is not the true gospel but a legalistic perversion of the gospel.",

				"The gospel is good news because brings a lasting answer to all your problems. It delivers you from bondage of sin that will ultimately destroy.",
				"It sets you on course that is for your highest good.",
				"It provides for you all things that pertain to life and godliness.",
				"iv It transforms your wants and desires so that they line up with God and His created purpose for you.",
				"And it turns you from a pathway of self-destruction to a pathway of eternal life, joy,",
				"and peace. In John 10:10 Jes##s characterized the devil as a thief set out to steal from you what is good and ultimately destroy you.",
				"“The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life,",
				"and that they might have it more abundantly” The NIV says, “…I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.",
				"” The gospel is a message of hope. The gospel is a declaration of God’s provision to meet your deepest needs.",
				"The gospel is good news for anyone who will hear it and receive it.",

				"B. The gospel is good news ABOUT Jes##s!",

				"Paul opens 1Cor. 15 with these words, “Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you….”",
				"Then he gives a condensed form of message. 1Cor. 15:3-4 “For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received:",
				"that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried,",
				"and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.” The death, burial,",
				"and resurrection of Jes##s are absolutely essential to the gospel.",

				"Without that, there is no good news. When so-called Christians abandon those truths,",
				"they are no longer Christians in the biblical sense. They may still call themselves Christians.",
				"But their message is no longer the gospel.",
				"Their message is a lie and departure from truth.",
				"Anytime a preacher denies the literal reality of Jes##s’ death on cross for atonement of sin or if a preacher denies the bodily resurrection of Jes##s,",
				"he has denied the faith. It does not matter how sweet he says it or how friendly his church is.",
				"It doesn’t matter if thousands feel uplifted by services or everybody just seems to love one another.",
				"If Jes##s atoning death and literal resurrection are not affirmed, then gospel not been preached.",

				"1Timothy 4:1 warns that in the last days “some will depart from the faith.” 2",
				"Thes. 2:3 says there will come a “falling away” or an apostasy. I don’t know what pressures will cause this to happen.",
				"The Timothy passage talks about seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.",
				"There are already social pressures in America to compromise these truths.",
				"It is rapidly becoming politically incorrect to stand up for biblical standards.",
				"If the culture continues on its current course, it will become harder and harder, more and more costly.",
				"We will have to be more and more anchored in our faith;",
				"we will have to be more firm in our commitment to Lord as the tides of public opinion turn against us.",
				"The result will be some who turn from the faith and some who turn to the Lord more wholeheartedly than ever.",
				"Middle of road will be a difficult & lonely path to navigate.",

				"As our society becomes more pluralistic, the name of Jes##s will be more and more more of an issue.",
				"The call will be to compromise with other groups for sake of peace. On the surface, it will sound loving and kind.",
				"But in reality, to do that will be to forsake our own mercy. To do that will be to abandon source of real life & real peace.",

				"In short order, we could find ourselves facing situations like the early church faced.",
				"Do you remember the healing of the lame man in Acts 3? Peter and John were on way to prayer at temple.",
				"They encountered a beggar who was lame. And by power of the Holy Spirit, the many was healed. When crowd gathered,",
				"Peter preached Jes##s as his explanation of what had happened.",

				"Acts 4:1-2 “Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple,",

				"These rulers were ok with people praying, as long as none of the prayers were answered.",
				"They were not upset by Peter & John joining others at temple. What upset them was Name of Jes##s!",
				"What upset them was the gospel, the good news of resurrection through Jes##s.",

				"They arrested Peter and John and brought them to trial. When asked by what authority they did these things,",

				"This is where the Gospel begins. The Savior of mankind has come to earth to live among men, to die for our sins,",

				"3. “The beginning of the Gospel,” (Mark 3:1) is the same as, “That which was from the beginning.” (John 1:1)",

				"Mark quotes prophecy from Isaiah and Malachi in verses 2 and 3 to give John the B#pt#st references.",
				"He was the one coming to fulfill these prophecies; to be the forerunner of Christ and to prepare the way for Him.",

				"And so John came baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. (Mark 1:4)",

				"It is important to note that John preached repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins, not of the forgiveness of sins.",

				"The six men mentioned in verse one allows us to date when this happened, because these men occur in secular history.",
				"We know something about these men. We have already discussed Herod. Tiberius Caesar was brilliant but brutal. He was clever,",
				"cunning, inhuman and profane. He tried to master the world.",

				"Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. Why were there two? Because of the power of Rome,",
				"Caiaphas was appointed by Rome to be the high priest, but Annas was the power behind the throne.",
				"Rome was involved with the religion of the nations that they conquered.",


				"John should have served in the temple, like his father did, because he was from the priestly tribe of Levi.",
				"But John hated what he saw in the temple. It was wrong and not what God wanted and he knew it,",
				"so he refused the office of priest and went into the desert where I believe that God trained him in the office of a prophet.",

				"John was one of those remarkable men that we meet in scripture from time to time. His methods were like those of Elijah,",

				"Now this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests to ask him who he was. (John: 1:19)",

				"A delegation was sent from Jerusalem to ask John a question, “Who are you?” His response is very important,",

				"“He must become greater; I must become less.” That should also be every Christian’s desire;",

				"He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Christ.” (John1:20)",

				"so they continued to question him. What great person was he?",

				"They asked him, 'Then who are you? Are you Elijah?' He said, 'I am not.' 'Are you the prophet?' He answered, 'No!' (John 1:21)",

				"John says that he is not the prophet Elijah, and that he is not “that other prophet,” spoken of in Deuteronomy,",
				"who would be like Moses.",

				"Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” (John 1:22)",

				"The delegation needs to know who he is, because that was their assignment. How does John answer them?",

				"John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the desert,",
				"‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’” (John 1:23)",

				"John quoted from Isaiah 40:3. He only claims to be a voice. That is all he wants to be. Jes##s is the Word.",
				"This should be a lesson for us. We should be a voice that speaks the word to declare the Gospel of Jes##s Christ.",
				"The Word is what is important.",

				"John has a great message, “Make straight the way for the Lord.”",
				"He is saying that the kingdom of God is at hand in the person of Jes##s Christ,",
				"and that they need to get ready for Him by getting rid of all the crocked things in their lives.",
				"That’s also a great message for us today. We need to get rid of all the crocked things and all the sin in our lives,",

				"we lie and do not live by the truth.”",

				"Now some Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, “why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah,",
				"nor that prophet?” (John 1:24-25)",

				"The Pharisees bring up a technical point. They say, “If you are none of these, why do you baptize?”",

				"Was Jes##s in the crowd? He could have been. I wonder.",

				"We call him John the B#pt#st, but he only used water. The one coming after him would baptize with fire and with the Holy Spirit.",

				"John tells them that the one that is coming after him is greater than he is. He is just a servant of the Great One,",

				"This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, when John was baptizing. (John 1:28)",

				"In this verse, the Gospel writer sets the stage for Jes##s to step forward to be recognized for the first time. In John 1:29,",

				"Q & A:",

				"Q. What’s all the fuss about? Why are some Christians giving so much attention to the end times?",
				"There seems to be so many different theories about it. And of course, everyone thinks his or her theory is right.",
				"Where did these theories come from? It is all very confusing to me.",

				"A. Depending on what you’ve heard, it certainly can be confusing.",
				"However, it should give us great comfort to know that God has a plan for our world,",
				"and it is all coming together according to His Divine purpose. Almighty God,",
				"who knows the end from the beginning, will make sure that everything turns out right in the end!",
				"First I will give you a little Historical background, and then I will offer my personal thoughts on the subject.",

				"I. Historical Background:",

				"The theories about the end times are sometimes described as Eschatology.",
				"Eschatology is the Theological term for the study of the end times or last days.",
				"One of the most prevalent theories regarding the end times espoused today is called Dispensationalism.",
				"This theory is fairly recent in terms of the span of Christian History.",
				"It was not until the late1800’s that it came into prominence by a man named John Nelson Darby.",
				"Darby was an Anglo-Irish evangelist, originally associated with the Plymouth Brethren. In 1848,",
				"he became involved in a complex dispute among the Plymouth Brethren that resulted in a split between “Open” Brethren",
				"and “Exclusive” Brethren. After that time, Darby was recognized as the dominant figure among the Exclusive Brethren.",
				"The Exclusive Brethren has been described as a separatist Christian group, a controversial offshoot of the Plymouth Brethren.",

				"John Darby is considered the father of modern Dispensationalism.",
				"Its name comes from the fact that dispensationalists see biblical history as best understood",
				"in light of a series of dispensations in the Bible. Each dispensation is said to represent a different way",
				"in which God deals with man. According to C. I. Scofield, “These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change",
				"in God’s method of dealing with mankind, in respect to two questions: of sin, and of man’s responsibility”.",

				"John Darby taught, and most subsequent dispensationalists have consistently maintained, that God looks upon the Jews",
				"as his chosen people and continues to have a place for them in the dispensational, prophetic scheme of things.",
				"While many traditions of Christianity teach that the Jews are a distinct people,",
				"dispensationalism is unique in teaching that the Church is a provisional dispensation,",
				"until the Jews finally recognize Jes##s as their promised Messiah during the trials that",
				"dispensationalists envision coming upon the Jews in the Great Tribulation.",

				"Darby also proposed a teaching that he called the “secret rapture”. The term rapture,",
				"which means to transport or carry away, is of Latin derivation. The word rapture is not found in the Bible.",
				"It is possibly a reference to a Scripture verse in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 “we shall be caught up.”",
				"The rapture is an event in certain systems of Christian Eschatology whereby it is believed that Jes##s Christ will return",
				"and take all Christians living on the Earth up into Heaven.",
				"The term “rapture” is usually applied specifically to the belief that Christians will be taken into heaven",
				"prior to the Second Coming of Christ.",

				"Of course there have many many variations on this subject since then.",
				"But even from this brief summary, you should be able to see that it can easily get rather involved.",

				"II. Personal thoughts:",

				"When I studied Christian Eschatology in Seminary we examined various theories regarding the end times.",
				"I was introduced to the Pre, Mid, and Post Tribulation theories.",
				"I could best relate to the Pan theory that my professor also mentioned. As he said,",
				"according to the Pan theory, it will all pan out. And I agree! I am by no means being facetious.",
				"I am confident that the Lord God Almighty is in complete control, and it will all pan out in the end!",
				"This may be a simplistic approach, but I do believe it is at least an honest one.",
				"Only God knows the real outcome of this old world, and there is nothing we can do about it.",

				"III. Biblical Facts:",

				"Will the Lord return? Yes He will! That has already been foretold.",
				"But when, where and how; that’s His prerogative.",
				"Jes##s Christ himself said that only the Father knew the time.",
				"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.",
				"(Matthew 24:36) Furthermore, when Christ ascended the angel of the Lord gave this admonition.",
				"“And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;",
				"Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jes##s,",
				"which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into heaven.",
				"Then they returned . . .” (Acts 1:10-12)",

				"We need to stop gazing up into Heaven trying to figure out when He will return,",
				"and get about the Father’s business. I adhere to the admonition of the Apostle John,",
				"author of Revelation, the book about the end times. “Beloved, now we are children of God;",
				"and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed,",
				"we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself,",
				"just as He is pure.”(1 John 3:2-3) Therefore, let us concentrate on our present life and walk in the Lord;",
				"and do as Jes##s instructed by taking no thought for tomorrow.",
				" We must seek God and His kingdom, and let Him take care of the details (Mathew 6:33).",
				" The future is God’s responsibility. He does all things well!",

				"Furthermore, as new creations in Christ we are the new Israel (Romans 9:6-8, Galatians 6:16).",
				"Therefore, our primary emphasis should be on the spiritual kingdom of Heaven (which is eternal)",
				"rather than the earthly kingdom of God (which is temporal). “For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly,",
				"nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly;",
				"and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter;",
				"and his praise is not from men, but from God” (Romans 2:28-29).",

				"Also, since the promise was given by God to Abraham and his seed (singular)",
				"“which is Christ” (Galatians 3:16), it behooves us to be sure that we are in Christ.",
				"This means we must receive Jes##s Christ into our lives as our Lord and Savior,",
				"so that we can be brought into vital union with Christ.",
				"Thus by virtue of the fact that we are made one with Christ “we are heirs of God,",
				"and joint-heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17).",

				"In Conclusion:",

				"Well so much more could be said. Suffice it to say that the kingdom God has for us is not of this world;",
				"because the kingdom of God is within us, where King Jes##s has come to rule and reign in our hearts.",
				"God has given us eternal life through Jes##s Christ our Lord. And that is sheer GRACE!",
				"So because of the grace of God that has been imparted to us through Christ,",
				"we need not be fearful of such things as the end times nor consumed by them.",
				"Therefore, we simply must not give in to curiosity, vain imaginations, and speculations regarding the end times.",

				"The only time we’ve got is now! So we should redeem the time,",
				"living now, by faith instead of by sight. That is how the Apostle Paul lived,",
				"“the life I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God” (Galatians 2:20).",
				"May God grant you the grace to live accordingly!"

				"For some of you this service may seem unusual for a life that was so brief.",
				"BIBLEJOHNATHAN died before he really had a change to live,",

				"Because all human life is sacred in God’s sight it is right and proper that we are here today.",

				"THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION IS ATTESTED TO BY THE FACT THAT",

				"1. God knows us even from the womb",

				"“Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee....” Jeremiah 1:5",

				"2. God has designed the unborn",

				"“You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb. (14)",

				"Mason was marvelous fashioned in the image of the creator.",

				"This little one has returned to the care of the Father. While on earth,",
				"Jes##s desired the company of little ones. It was Jes##s who took the little children up in his arms and said,",
				"“Suffer the little children...to come unto me; for such is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt 19:14).",
				"Today he resides in Heaven. In the arms of our dear Savior he is secure and safe and blessed.",

				"We are sure that little ones go to be with Jes##s because we believe that little",
				"ones who are not yet old enough to understand sin and the need for a savior go to be with the Lord when they die.",

				"THIRD, WE CAN KNOW THAT HIS LIFE AS BRIEF AS IT",

				"WAS, WAS NOT WITHOUT PURPOSE",

				"His life as brief as it was has brought us here today.",

				"His life has brought you here today,",
				"Perhaps this little one has returned to the Father in order to point the way for some older sheep.",

				"Several thousand years ago King David lost a young son. He said something at the time that might help us today.",

				"He said, “I can not bring him back to me. I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.” (2 Samuel 12:23)",

				"Today I would like to close by just briefly telling you how to get where BIBLEJOHNATHAN is. Jes##s said about himself,",
				"“I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the father but by me.” (Jn. 14:6)",

				"Because our sins separate us from a holy God, we need to understand that we are sinners and that we need to be saved.",

				"After challenging the pharisees and scribes Jesus told the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus to show that being rich should not be equated with being righteous.",
				"The rich man had everything he wanted. But he didn't have what would get him to heaven.",
				"[This parable further illustrates the point made in the previous about the money manager about preparing for the future here and now.]",

				"The parable is about two contrasting individuals. One material possession and the other served God in this life (16:13).",
				"It depicts the permanent reality of the hereafter in contrast to the temporary present.",

				"The details in the story are colorful and the contrast is sharp. For the rich man earthly life is a daily feast. For the poor man,",
				"clothed in running sores, who lies among the dogs, life is torturous. Both die but only the rich man is buried. In eternity their roles reverse and the outcome is unalterable.",

				"[The second parable raises the question of stewardship versus entitlement. We are in a time in America where we all think we are entitled.",
				"Charles W. Bray III as Deputy Director of the U.S. Internal Communication Agency, wrote something perceptive about entitlement in Quote magazine (Jan. 15, 1981).",

				"if we're rich, we deserve a tax break; if we are workers, we deserve better fringe benefits; if we own Chrysler or GM, we deserve a bail-out;",
				"if we are a special interest, we deserve a special hearing.']",

				"The Pharisees thought they were entitled. They had the strange idea that money was deserved. Money was a sign that they were blessed by God,",
				"and poverty was the result of God’s curse. Jesus repudiates that whole idea. [Larson, Bruce, The Preacher's Commentary Series,",

				"But God records Lazarus name while the rich man remains nameless. [Courson, Jon: Jon Courson's Application Commentary.",
				"Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2003, S. 382.] Note that Lazarus is counted as righteous not because he was poor but because he depended on God.",
				"Yet his poverty and inability to help himself gave him the opportunity to become great in faith which Jesus' brother taught us in James 2:5. [Also see Jas 1:9.]",

				"The poor man's longing is recorded in verse 21. and longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man’s table;",
				"but the dogs were coming and licking his sores.",

				"The poor was longing for the crumbs which were falling off the rich man's table. [The same longing is said of the lost son in 15:16.]",
				"Regrettable, the wealthy man had no concept of stewardship and thought only about his comfort or he would have done something at",
				"least to help the suffering beggar Lazarus. Obviously he didn't recall such Scriptures as Proverbs 14:21; 19:17: 21:13; or 28:27.",
				"The one who enjoyed feasts and parties had no concern for the one who was suffering at his door step.",

				"Though the wealthy man felt no compassion toward Lazarus, the dogs did.",

				"Bear in mind that Jesus is not using this parable to condemn the rich nor suggesting that all the poor will all go to heaven.",
				"Jesus doesn't question how the rich man got his money or that he has it. The rich man isn't even necessarily a bad man.",
				"But whatever else he was, in this story he is blind to the person in need who is sitting outside his gate.",

				"II. A TRANSITION TO THE NEXT LIFE, 22-23.",

				"Verse 22 indicates that both men died. 'Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's bosom;",
				"and the rich man also died and was buried.'",

				"In the course of time both men died. Lazarus, though too poor to afford a funeral,",
				"was transported by angels into the presence of Abraham, a place of blessedness.",
				"In heaven he was given a place of honor in proximity to Abraham's bosom.",
				"'Abraham's side apparently refers to a place of paradise for Old Testament believers at the time of death (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 12:4).",

				"In spite of his wealth the rich man also died and was given no doubt a fine burial.",
				"I imagine he too was expecting to arrive to be with Abraham and continue to enjoy the good life.",

				"Verse 23 contrasts the eternal destiny of the rich man with the eternal destiny of the beggar.",
				"'In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.'",

				"At death the rich man receives no heavenly escort but finds himself in hades. Hades, the Greek word some translate 'hell'",
				"(NIV) is used 11 times in the New Testament. The Septuagint used had to translate the Hebrew šeôl (the place of the dead) on 61 occasions.",
				"Here hades refers to the abode of the unsaved dead prior to the great white throne judgment (Rev. 20:11-15).",

				"[Apparently everyone who died before Jesus was crucified to pay for the sins of mankind went to sheol, 'the place of the grave.'",
				"Jesus' parable divided it into two compartments, separated by a great divide. One side was filled with fire and torment.",
				"The other side was a place called 'Abraham's bosom' or 'paradise.' Those who loved God would go to the paradise,",
				"or Abraham's bosom side of sheol. The reason they couldn't go directly to heaven is because the blood of Christ had not yet been shed.",
				"So paradise was simply a waiting room. And Abraham, the Father of Faith, the Friend of God, would greet them there.",
				"Those who did not believe in God went to the torment side of sheol. And although there was a great gulf between the two,",
				"as seen in this passage, those on both sides could call out to one another, which would make the flaming side even more hellish.",

				"Ephesians 4:8-9 tells us that before Jesus ascended into heaven,",
				"He first descended into the lower parts of the earth and led those in Abraham's bosom up to heaven.",
				"That is why Abraham's bosom no longer exists today.] Hades is not the final destiny of the unbeliever,",
				"but rather only a temporary holding tank until after the Great White Throne Judgment when he will be cast into Gehenna,",
				"or outer darkness (Revelation 20). Contrary to popular belief, hell is not going to be one big New Year's Eve party.",
				"Gehenna is a place of heat without light, of eternal isolation, of interminable torment.",
				"[Courson, Jon: Jon Courson's Application Commentary. Nashville, TN : Thomas Nelson, 2003, S. 382.]",
				"In hades the rich man finally saw 'afar of' or saw the bigger picture of existence.",
				"[Makrothymia is a composite word from makran, far away and thymos, anger, literally far away from anger.]",
				"The world says, 'Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,' because they only see what is in front of them.",
				"In death they'll finally see afar off; they'll finally see the big picture of eternity. But it will be too late.",

				"In the context of this chapter, the rich man's sin was not that he hated Lazarus, but simply that he neglected him.",
				"The Bible says there are sins of commission, things we do that are wrong, and sins of omission,",
				"failing to do that which is right (James 4:17). There was a person in need at the rich man’s gate,",
				"but he didn't offer to help. And that was his sin, indicative that because he cared not about the man at his gate,",
				"he had not the love of God in his heart (1 John 3:17). [Courson, S. 382.]",

				"III. TWO DESTINATIONS IN DEATH, 24-26.",

				"Verse 24 interestingly indicates that the rich man began to pray. 'And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham,",
				"have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'",

				"The rich man is depicted as being able to converse with Abraham, even calling him father. First he prays for himself.",
				"He begs Abraham to have mercy on him and allow Lazarus to bring him a touch of water. Extreme thirsts is one of the most terrible pains we can suffer.",

				"Another kind of agony or torment is the flame (Mt. 3:10-12). Despite his circumstances he still sees Lazarus as someone to be ordered around",
				"someone who should relief his circumstance when he did nothing on earth to relief the circumstances of Lazarus.",

				"[If he had only realized his thirst while living he could have come to Jesus the Living Water.",
				"Jesus said in John 7:37 that any man, brokenhearted or out-cast, atheist or idolater, forsaken or forgotten,",
				"poor or rich may come and drink of this Living Water. Yet we must come to Him. It’s not enough to wish or resolve or hope;",
				"we must act. We must acknowledge our thirst and come to Jesus and partake of the life that only He can give. Have you come to lay your life before Jesus?]",

				"Abraham gives two reason that comfort could not be brought to the formerly rich man in verses 25 & 26 .",
				"In verse 25 the formerly rich man could not be helped because his character has now become unalterable.",
				"But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things;",
				"but now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony.",

				"These words capture the reversal of fortunes or circumstance to which Jesus is speaking..",
				"Abraham replied that it was not possible that he could be help and that he should remember that during life",
				"he had everything he wanted while Lazarus had had nothing. Even so, the rich man had never helped Lazarus during the course of his life.",
				"The man had lived for the good things of earth only caring about experiencing an abundance of earthly blessings.",
				"It is too late after death to change the way you lived because of who your were on earth.",
				"[Jesus elevates the man disdained by the Pharisees and humbles the man they would have considered blessed.]",

				"Although people mistakenly believe that, at worst, when they die they will cease to exist,",
				"the fact is that not only will they continue to exist, but they will be able to remember the good things they received on earth,",
				"the blessings God poured out upon them, the patience God showed to them, the many opportunities He gave them to turn to Him.",
				"Therefore, I suggest that one of the most horrendous aspects of hell is the memory people will have of the times they could have received the free gift of salvation,",
				"but chose to harden their hearts instead. [Courson, Jon: Jon Courson's Application Commentary. Nashville, TN : Thomas Nelson, 2003, S. 382.]",

				"Again Jesus uses the word agony or torment. He uses it four times in this parable. It indicates real and definite pain.",

				"Abraham gives another reason in verse 26 that comfort could not be brought to the formerly rich man.",
				"And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed,",
				"so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.",

				"Additionally a great chasm separated paradise and hades so that no one could cross from one to the other.",
				"Jesus [doesn't seem to be describing a literal gulf between paradise and Hades; rather, He]",
				"seems to be using the great chasm imagery to describe the permanence of our characters' eternal destinies.",
				"Torment is one's eternal recompense and comfort is Lazarus eternal blessing.",

				"IV. A PLEA FOR GREATER PERSUASION, 27-31.",

				"[Up to this point all that has been said in warning and in instruction about material things comes vividly to mind.",
				"Lazarus enjoys the bliss of Abraham's bosom while the rich man lies in Hades.] In verses 27-31 a second vital point is made.",
				"The Scriptures are sufficient for faith and when they are rejected, as the rich man has done (Mic. 2:9; Isa. 58:7),",
				"not even an event as extraordinary as a resurrection will generate belief. That proved true in the case of Jesus.",

				"The rich man next in verse 27 begged that Lazarus be sent to earth to warn his brothers.And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my father's house",

				"If Lazarus can't come over here, send him back from the dead to tell my family that this place exists,",
				"begged the rich man. Explain the terrible reality of hell and the glory of heaven to them.",

				"I find it interesting that the rich man realized the power of a testimony or witness. He didn't say,",
				"Send a theologian, a Bible teacher, or a preacher.' He said,Send the one who",
				"[, although he was poor and covered with sores,] believed in God and is now in His presence that he may share his testimony.",

				"If you haven't already, you will hear Satan whisper in your ear,",
				"You can't witness because you don't know enough about the Bible; you're not that solid in your own walk",
				"your understanding of theology is too elementary.' That's a lie! The most powerful thing you can share is your own testimony (Rev. 12:11).",

				"After he was cornered by the Pharisees, the once-blind man simply said,I can't answer all of your questions concerning the nature and Person of Jesus.",
				"But this I do know: Once I was blind, but now I see.' And none could deny it (John 9:25).",
				"So, too, the most powerful thing you can tell your unsaved parents or a lost neighbor is simply what the Lord has done for you. [Courson, S. 382.]",
				"In verse 28 the rich man now wants to prevent his family members from having to share his torturous fate. for I have five brothers",
				"'in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.",

				"The formerly rich man now has a concern for his lost brothers, he wants to warn them, but he could do nothing about it.",
				"After we die it is too late to do anything to lead people to eternal salvation in Jesus Christ.",

				"Also notice that the rich's man concern had not changed in spite of his tormented condition. He was still self-centered.",
				"He prayed only for his comfort and the safety of his family. He was not concerned about the lost, only about his five brothers.",
				"How tragic that even the reality and torment of hell does not change condition the lost's heart.",

				"On April 19, 1995 at 9:02 a.m.', the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was BOMBED resulting in the death of 168 people.",
				"Three men were ultimately arrested and tried for what at that time was the his worst act of terrorism ever on United States soil.",
				"Do you remember them? They were Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier. Timothy McVeigh was found guilty and sentenced to death,",
				"Terry Nichols was found guilty as a coconspirator and sentenced to life in prison.",

				"The third defendant, Michael Fortier, was found guilty and sentenced to pay a $200,000 fine and serve 12 years in prison.",
				"He was not found guilty of developing, deploying, or detonating the bomb. His crime was that he knew about the bombing before it occurred and failed to inform anyone.",

				"Are we guilty of knowing the reality of hell and the opportunity of heaven and failing to warn others of the coming judgment?",

				"Verse 29 calls us to realize that the Scripture is all we need to lead people to faith in Jesus.But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.'",

				"Abraham points out that they already have the Word of God. The Word of God is not only sufficient,",
				"it is the most powerful means in existence to bring people to faith.",

				"If one will not be convince about the gospel of Jesus Christ and the reality of eternal existence in either heaven or hell,",
				"nothing else could convince them. That is the supreme power and authority of the Word of God.",

				"The California-based FLAT EARTH Research Society, founded in 1800,",
				"is devoted to the purpose of proving that the earth is flat and that modern astronomical science is a fraud.",
				"When photos of Earth were televised from American spacecraft more than 20 years ago,",
				"confirming the spherical shape of our planet, the Flat Earth Society said the photos were fakes.",

				"Human beings have an uncanny ability to reject what they don't want to believe, regardless of the evidence.",
				"For example, nurses report that they sometimes find emphysema patient smoking in bed,",
				"alternating between puffs of smoke and whiffs of oxygen despite the overwhelming medical evidence that the practice is killing them.",
				"And it is not uncommon forworst-case' alcoholics to deny that they have a drinking problem.",

				"The five brothers of the rich man in Jesus' parable knew the-law given through Moses, and had refused to obey it.",
				"Confronted by prophetic warnings, they had turned their backs. Their problem was not hardness of hearing, but hardness of heart.",
				"And the pleas of a resurrected beggar would not have changed anything. May we pray for the courage to accept what is true even when it is more comfortable to ignore it.",

				"Yet it was the rich man's contention in verse 30 that if one came back from the dead then his brothers would listen then.",
				"But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!'",

				"The man reasoned,Even though they're not listening to the Word, if someone comes back from the dead, surely they will listen and repent.",
				"In hell people finally realize the need to repent, not to believe in theology, but to repent from iniquity.",
				"Tragically, there will be those who believe in the existence of Jesus and in the inspiration of Scripture who will be lost eternally because of their refusal to repent,",
				"to change direction, to follow Jesus. The devils and demons believe, James tells us (2:19),",
				"but they're not saved because their belief is based on intellectual acknowledgment rather than humble,",
				"personal repentance that leads to a change of life. [Couson, 383]",

				"Jesus makes it clear in verse 31 that people have enough light but still miss the obvious truth.",
				"But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'",

				"Abraham replied that if they refused to listen to the Scriptures",
				"[Moses and the Prophets represents or was the common designation for all the O.T. (v. 16)],",
				"then they would refuse to listen to one who came back from the dead.",

				"If God's prophetic Word cannot convince and crack a hard heart,",
				"neither will great miracles. Jesus own resurrection is proof that only an open heart sees the evidence for God’s presence and hears His pleading voice.",

				"[Jesus' implication was that the rich man symbolized the Pharisees.",
				"They wanted sign-signs so clear that they would compel people to believe.",
				"But since they refused to believe the Scriptures, they would not believe any sign no matter how great.]",

				"Just a short time later Jesus did raise a man from the dead, another man named Lazarus (John 11:38-44).",
				"The result was that the religious leaders began to plot more earnestly to kill both Jesus and Lazarus (John 11:45-53; 12:10-11).",
				"[It could also be a veiled reference to Jesus’ resurrection. In that case neither did Jesus’ resurrection change their thinking.]",

				"IN CLOSING,",

				"Living presumptuously with no compassion for people and no thought of eternity caused the rich man to end up in a real place called hell.",
				"The wicked do not just cease to exist but go to a place of torment. Jesus said hell is real indeed. God desires none should perish",
				"(2 Peter 3:9) there. In fact, if you insist upon going there, you will have to do so over Jesus dead body, and His shed blood.",
				"In considering this passage, may we be renewed in our compassion and commitment.",
				"First, may we be renewed in our compassion and commitment to share what the Lord has given us.",
				"May we be willing to share what we cannot keep to gain what we cannot lose.",
				"Second may we be renewed in our compassion and commitment to share the good news with the lost.",
				"May we be reminded of the big picture of eternity and the power of a testimony. In other words,",
				"because we've considered hell, may we become more mindful of heaven.",

				"I believe there are many people within 5 miles of this spot that would like to go to heaven but God can't find anyone to tell them how.",
				"Can He count on you to share your testimony with someone before its too late?"}

				"The End Times.",

				"Mt 24 is one of the hardest chapters in the Gospels to understand. Because Jes##s speaks of future events.",

				"Jes##s prophesies quite clearly the Fall of the Temple in Jerusalem in Mt 24:2 ",
				"- that actually happened in AD 70 – and with it came the end of the Jewish era.",

				"But he also prophesies the end of the world too.",

				"And we will be wise to learn from history.",

				"As Michael Green so ably put it:",

				"“ History is going somewhere. It is not meaningless. It is not random . It is not eternal.",

				"There will be a real end just as there was a real beginning. And at the end of it, we will find Jes##s Christ.",
				"(Michael Green – The Message of Matthew p.253)",

				"History is in a real sense Jes##s’ story.",

				"“He made the world, He came to dwell in it. He will return at the end of history to wind it up”",

				"(Michael Green – The Message of Matthew p. 250)",

				"We can learn from history - and we live in the present - but why did Jes##s bother to tell us about the future.",

				"I can think of three reasons:",

				"1. Firstly to warn us so we are not led astray by false prophets",

				"There has always been a propensity for people to be attracted by prophetic utterances about the future",

				"Story: In the late 19th Century in America there was an enthusiasm for such prophecies predicting the actual date for Christ’s",
				"Second Coming.",

				"One such prophet was an Adventist leader William Miller (1782-1849).",
				"And it is in his movement that both the JW’s and the Seventh Day Adventists find their roots.",

				"Miller first predicted that Christ would return on 21st March 1842, but then revised the date to April 3, 1843.",

				"You might have thought that the movement would have died. But it didn’t. Rather it continued to grow.",
				"Miller decided to recalculate his date for the Second Coming and soon publicised a new date - April 18, 1844.",

				"When the messiah did not show up on that date, there was again frustration and some followers left the Adventist ranks.",

				"Undeterred by these failures, Miller came up with a third date - 22nd October 1844.",

				"As doomsday approached, the Millerites began to prepare.",

				"One account notes that “Fields were left unharvested, shops were closed, people quit their jobs, paid their debts,",
				"and freely gave away their possessions with no thought of repayment.”",

				"William Miller himself began peddling white “ascension robes” to the faithful,",
				"many of whom waited for the miraculous event in freshly dug graves.",

				"But as we all know, the Second Coming did not occur on 22nd October 1844.",

				"Christ is eager to spare his followers the pain of the let down that false prophets bring",
				"– and the real sense of loss that accompanies it.",

				"2. The second reason Christ gave this prophecy",
				"was to remind his Church that he wants us to keep his mission in the forefront of our hearts and minds.",

				"For Jes##s summed up the End Times like this",

				"14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.",

				"The primary goal of the Church is to preach the message of the kingdom of God – and not to be sidetracked by “idle speculations”.",
				"We need to keep our eye on the ball.",

				"3. But the third reason I believe Jes##s gave this prophecy was so we could be ready for the events when they come",
				"It is a bit like hazard lights on a motorway. They warn you of a hazard up ahead before you reach it",

				"Many of Jes##s’ hearers were going to live through a cataclysmic event – the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem.",

				"It turned out to be a terrible siege that lasted four years. The city was defended with fanaticism.",

				"The Romans tried to starve the Jews out and in the end, the inhabitants resorted to cannibalism.",

				"A million Jews were killed and almost a hundred thousand were taken into captivity.",
				"Story: The 3rd Century historian Eusebius records an interesting story.",
				"Some Jewish Christians living in Jerusalem got out just before the siege and fled to Pella in Transjordan.",
				"Why – the reason Eusebius gives is that they left in response to “an oracle given by revelation”.",
				"Were they were simply heeding Jes##s’ words?",

				"In conclusion:",

				"1. Jes##s gave us prophecy so that we will not be led astray by false prophets.",

				"2. As we see cataclysmic events around us – it is easy to take our eye off the ball .",

				"The Church is called to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom – and not to be caught up in star gazing",

				"Story: As Martin Luther is once reputed to have said: “If I knew Christ was coming tomorrow, I would still plant an apple tree.”",

				"3. And finally we need to be ready for the future.",

				"There will be an end to this world – not by our own doings but when God’s time is right.",

				"We don’t need to worry –it is in God’s hands",

				"But the question is – will we be we ready for it?"

				"roof and so one, wisdom is a result of seven important things in your life.",
				"You need to choose to have these seven attributes or character traits before you get wisdom.",
				"Without these pillars you are not wise; you will not attain wisdom. ",
				"So I want to take a look at the ‘Seven Pillars’ wisdom is built on and then we will consider how to ‘get’ wisdom.",
				"Our Scripture says,",

				"Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.”",

				"Proverbs 9:1",

				"In the previous chapter those pillars were described. Here is the first one.",

				"“I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence...” Proverbs 8:12",

				"Without prudence you don’t have wisdom. We better get a good understanding of what prudence is,",
				"don’t you think? Prudence is not a word we use very much. Its meaning is lost on most of us today,",
				"but at one time it was common and everyone understood what it meant. I had a pretty good idea of what it was,",
				"but I looked it up and here is what I found.",

				"Prudence: 1. Caution with regard to practical matters; discretion.",

				"2. Provident care in the management of resources.",

				"Synonyms: Prudence, calculation, foresight, forethought imply attempted provision against possible contingencies.",
				"PRUDENCE is care, caution, and good judgment,",
				"as well as wisdom in looking ahead; FORESIGHT implies a prudent looking ahead rather far into the future:",
				"clear foresight in planning. FORETHOUGHT emphasizes the adequacy of preparation for the future.",

				"To be prudent is to think ahead. It is to anticipate. Being prudent is to be prepared.",
				"I thought that was pretty cool since I am into Emergency Preparedness",
				"and lead an action group in the local Tea Party that deals with it.",

				"When you read Proverbs you read quite a bit of stuff on being prepared and looking ahead.",
				"One of my favorite verses on the subject says,",

				"“The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools devours all they have.”",

				"Proverbs 21:20",

				"It is wise to be prudent. It is wise to plan ahead. It is wise to give careful thought to what lies ahead",
				"– and prepare for it. Wisdom is built on prudence.",

				"Wisdom is also built on, 2. Knowledge and discretion. Knowledge is accumulating information.",
				"It is learning. But discretion is not usually associated with knowledge. Discretion is, according to the dictionary,",

				"“The power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgment; freedom of judgment or choice.",
				"EXAMPLE : “It is entirely within my discretion whether I will go or stay.”",

				"I think wisdom is built on using your discretion to accumulate knowledge. The wise person makes it happen.",
				"The wise person goes to school, college, take classes, and/or studies at home. We need to keep growing;",
				"we need to keep learning; we need to continue to acquire knowledge. It is a wise thing to do.",

				"Wisdom is built on knowledge and discretion.",

				"The third pillar of wisdom is to 3. Fear the Lord. The Bible says,",

				"“The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.”",

				"Job 28:28",

				"“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding.",
				"To him belongs eternal praise.”",

				"Psalm 111:10",

				"“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.” Proverbs 1:7",

				"“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” Proverbs 9:10",

				"“Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the Lord...” Proverbs 15:33",

				"It is an unwise thing to not fear or respect the Lord.",
				"Yet some of the worlds most brilliant minds CHOOSE to not believe in or respect or fear God. And the Bible calls them ‘fools’.",
				"Why? Because God has made Himself plain in the things He has made.",
				"(Romans 1:18-21) Only a fool would choose to believe a lie is the truth and the truth is a lie.",
				"Choose to fear God; to respect Him is just the BEGINNING of wisdom.",
				"If you want to be wise – begin with belief in and respect for the Lord. And by the way,",
				"wisdom ‘hates’ or is separate from evil, pride, arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.",
				"The wise person does not have these qualities in his life.",

				"The fourth pillar of wisdom is ‘counsel’. I think what this means is that the wise man will take counsel.",
				"To not listen to counsel is unwise. The Bible says,",

				"“Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.”",

				"Proverbs 15:22",

				"“Mockers resent correction, so they avoid the wise.” Proverbs 15:12",

				"Too many people do not seek out counsel when they embark upon a course of action. In fact,",
				"some get down right irritated and angry if you try to give them advice. The wise person seeks counsel.",
				"The wise person goes first to the source of wisdom. The Bible says,",

				"“To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.”",

				"Job 12:13",

				"The truly wise person always begins by listening to God and seeking His counsel by reading and knowing His Word. The result?",

				"“Whoever heeds life-giving correction will be at home among the wise.”",

				"Proverbs 15:31",

				"The fifth pillar of wisdom is sound judgment. Sound judgment is,",

				"“the capacity to assess situations or circumstances shrewdly and to draw sound conclusions.”",

				"It is the wise person who is able to check out a situation and intelligently draw a solid conclusion to it.",
				"There is a process here. There is fact finding, information examination, and thoughtful deduction before reaching a sound judgment.",
				"A foolish person is rash.",
				"A foolish person does things and says things without any thought process; without any thought of the consequence or result.",

				"“The tongue of the wise adorns knowledge, but the mouth of the fool gushes folly.” Proverbs 15:2",

				"“The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil.” Proverbs 15:28",

				"“To answer before listening— that is folly and shame.” Proverbs 18:13",

				"Do you begin to see that it is foolish to speak before thinking? It is foolish to say whatever pops into your mind.",
				"It is foolish to answer before listening - really listening to a person.",
				"Sometimes you may have to understand the tone of the voice",
				"or the body language or the background of the individual before you can answer wisely.",
				"The wise person calculates; he thinks; he ponders – before speaking and reaching sound judgment.",

				"The sixth pillar of wisdom is ‘understanding’. If you don’t understand you can’t be very wise.",
				"So, how do we get understanding? The Bible says,",

				"“My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,",

				"turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding— indeed,",
				"if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,",
				"and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,",
				"then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. For the LORD gives wisdom;",

				"from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.” Proverbs 2:1-6",

				"“But it is the spirit in a person, the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.",
				"It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.” Job 32:8-9",

				"I think it is clear that understanding comes, first from the Lord, and secondly, by applying our heart to it.",
				"The Scriptures says to call out for it; to cry out loud for it.",
				"It tells us to search for it like we would for hidden treasure or precious metals.",
				"Jes##s said to ask and seek and knock. That is how we get understanding. We are to h##ger and thirst for understanding.",
				"We need to deeply desire to know and understand.",

				"In our day and age the majority of people are lulled into ignorance by the media and the entertain industry.",
				"Have you heard of the “dumbing down of America”? It’s real. I could give you all kinds of facts and figures.",
				"But let me encourage you to try to understand what is going on. Dig for it. Seek for understanding. It’s the wise thing to do.",
				"The bible says,",
				"“Fools find no pleasure in understanding but delight in airing their own opinions.” Proverbs 18:2",
				"The last thing wisdom is build on; the last pillar is “Power”.",

				"Have you ever heard the saying, “Knowledge is power”? That’s not entirely true. It is in wisdom that the power lies.",
				"The Bible says,",

				"“Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.”",

				"Ecclesiastes 7:19",

				"When a person is wise he has influence. When a person is wise he can control the strong and the influential and the wealthy.",
				"The wise person has power over rulers and armies and countries. Do you want power like this? The Bible tells us where it comes from.",

				"“...the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!” Psalm 68:35",

				"It is God who is the source of true power. If we want power – we go to God. Do you sense a reoccurring theme here?",
				"God is the source of all that is good.",

				"Well, wisdom is built seven pillars. Let’s list them.",

				"1. Prudence; 2. Knowledge; 3. Fear of the Lord; 4. Counsel; 5. Sound Judgment; 6. Understanding; and 7. Power.",

				"We need more wisdom in our lives; in our Church and in our Country. So how do we get it? If we want wisdom we go to God. Solomon Wrote,",
				"“For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.” Proverbs 2:6",

				"“If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.” James 1:5",

				"When we began I mentioned that one of the disciplines I have incorporated into my life and have made a habit is daily Bible reading.",
				"Another one is daily prayer for wisdom.",
				"I make a lot of mistakes and do a lot of foolish things.",
				"I say the wrong thing at times and often put my foot in my mouth.",
				"But I’m learning. I’m seeking. I’m trying to do better.",
				"The intent of my heart is to be more Christlike – and for that I need daily wisdom. And I ask for it – daily.",

				"Do you understand that wisdom may be lost? I began by talking about the wisest man who ever lived – King Solomon.",
				"But He got away from God and lost His wisdom and His kingdom and caused the Lord to become angry with Him.",
				"He turned away from God (1 Kings 11:4-11) and God turned away from Him. I pray that never happens to you.",
				"My prayer for you is for more wisdom. Paul said,",

				"I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jes##s Christ, the glorious Father,",
				"may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.” Ephesians 1:17",

				"That is my prayer for you as well. We need wisdom so we can know Christ better.",
				"May God give you and me more wisdom so we may know Him even better."

				"The Greek word for filling is to make full to be complete it's like a sponge which is full of water,",
				"a wedding banquet hall which is full of people, it also deals with the filling of our lives.",
				"Last weekend and this week the teaching really centers around the idea of whatever fills you controls you",
				"---if you drink too much alcohol, you're controlled by the spirit of the alcohol,",
				"you do drugs you get controlled by the drugs, if you have rage inside of you--- you are controlled by that rage and anger.",

				"Last week we looked at the first five points of the filling of the Holy Spirit.",

				"First we are dead in our sin but the Spirit makes us alive in Christ.",

				"Second the filling of the Spirit shows that we belong to the Lord Jes##s Christ and we are heirs we are in that inheritance",
				"with God through Jes##s Christ.",

				"Third, the Holy Spirit pours out his love within our hearts and as that love is poured out to us we are able to offer",

				"you do you have a good Study Bible,",
				"a good study Bible to help you read and have the Holy Spirit help you understand what you are reading",
				"so the filling of the Holy Spirit",
				"enables us to understand and apply Scripture more completely",

				"within our lives.",

				"The indwelling of the Holy Spirit point number seven enriches the believers prayer life and the Holy Spirit intercession for US.",
				"Have you ever had a hard time praying ",
				"---if you are like me at times--I have sometimes I feel like my prayers never get past the ceiling---",
				"sometimes I feel like my prayers aren't don't even get past my own brain,",
				"but we're told through Scripture the Apostle Paul says,",
				"“likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness because at times we do not know what to pray.”",
				"for Paul says in Romans 8 but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us is that amazing the Holy Spirit prays for us.",
				"The Holy Spirit intercedes for us. The Holy Spirit is the one that that is pleading our case to God the Father.",

				"The eighth point comes in the fact of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit empowers the believer to do Christ's will.",
				"I can't do Christ’s will in my life without the power and the strength of the Holy Spirit.",

				"Now I can't say for sure that that most of the people that ran the Underground Railroad were Christians",

				"We would NOT have all this rage and anger",

				"within our society when we give our lives to Jes##s Christ",
				"--- and having the Holy Spirit dwelling within us.",

				"Number 10, is simply that the indwelling Spirit causes us to grieve for our sin. The Holy Spirit causes us ",
				"-- leads us to realize our sin in our life and to confess that sin.",
				"Jes##s Christ says he is faithful to forgive us our sins if we confess our sin.",
				"I have so much sin in my life that I need to continually be confessing my sin to God,",
				"there is none that is righteous no not one. Scripture says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us,",
				"and for that Lord we give you thanks and praise but we are called to confess our sins.",

				"And we can only do that through the Holy Spirit---",

				"Number 11, the Holy Spirit seals us for the day of the judgement time.",
				"Paul says we are sealed with the Holy Spirit as a promise who is the guarantee of our inheritance.",
				"This gets back to the fact that that we are part of that inheritance we are sealed by God by the Holy Spirit--- we are sealed",

				"we are in that family",
				"--- so that we are guaranteed presence with the Lord for eternity. Christianity is the only",
				"--- friends Christianity is the only religion that's not based on works ",

				"---of the fruit of the Spirit ---of the inheritance that we have--- of the love",

				"Before the time of Christ the Jews were granted favor through the Old Covenant of circumcision", 
				" but now Gentile and Jew alike are saved through baptism, the promise of the New Covenant.", 
				" It is through baptism that we are given the grace to do good things onto others, to preach to others,", 
				" and to become one with God on judgment. Baptism is the cleansing of all sins for God forgives when you come to Him.", 
				" But I shall explain to you the purpose of baptism and its significance.", 

				"The need for baptism comes from the reality of Original Sin, a sin that taints all human beings.", 
				" It is not an offense in which one commits or earns but rather a sin that originates with Adam and Eve.", 
				" With the fall of Adam and Eve comes the heavy price that every man is tainted with sin and without baptism will be depraved of the graces necessary for salvation.", 

				"The eating of the fruit condemns Adam and Eve to a spiritual death, ", 
				"(Gen. 2:17) for they did not die on the day that they ate the fruit. ", 
				"Rather they died inside and from that day Satan was cursed for corrupting man into disobeying God’s command. ", 
				"Women from that time forth were forced to feel the pains of childbirth and man was forever to labor and toil for his nourishment.", 
				" (Gen. 3:14-19) As Satan shall be cursed, women shall feel pains, and man shall toil,", 
				" so be it that all of humanity from that time on be tainted with original sin.", 

				"But why should man have to face such a burden due to the sin of just those two? It is necessary in order to bring man to God. ", 
				"In the Garden of Eden God was always present and in no place could Adam hide. ", 
				"Outside the Garden it is necessary for man to declare his dependency and faith in God.", 
				" Without baptism are we no better than Cain and his descendents? ", 
				" They were children of Adam and Eve yet they did not follow God and were destroyed in Noah’s flood.", 

				"And so the descendent of Seth, Noah, ", 
				"was saved from the waters and was granted a Covenant that declared that the world was safe from another flood.", 
				" And so it was revealed to the Jews, the descendents of Abraham and Isaac of original sin. For indeed,", 
				" how can something of sin, how can one that is unclean, bear a child that is pure. Even an infant a few days old is unclean and full of trouble. (Job 14:1-4)", 

				"We can admit as a people that we are born in inequity and that we have been conceived of sin. (Psalm 51:5) However, ", 
				"there is still hope and is through the grace of baptism. For Adam’s sin entered the world, caused death by sin,", 
				" and so death is passed to all men, it is thus that all men has sinned. (Romans 5:12)", 
				" But we are given a free gift of baptism but it is not just for Original Sin but in the many offenses against justification.", 
				" The obedience of Christ has allowed for the free gift of baptism that may make many worthy of justification. (Romans 5:16-19)", 

				"Through Adam there came death but through Christ there is life. (1 Cor. 15:21) For man without the grace of God is corrupt, ", 
				"sinful, wrathful, disobedient, and works in the fulfillment of the flesh and not of the spirit. (Ephesians 2:1-3) ", 
				"It is needed the grace of baptism for a change in our nature and in our justification.", 

				"Why does Paul bring up the sin of Adam? To reminds us of an irrelevant fact? No, for he reminds us the true reality of man. ", 
				"Man is unclean from the moment of conception for no creature can be pure of sin from a creature that is unclean except Christ.", 
				" For how is it possible for such a person to be perfect from an imperfect being? But how can an infant sin or even a child?", 
				" Within each and every person is the desire, the thought, the possibility to sin.", 
				" And this possibility and ability to sin makes us different from Christ who had none.", 
				" In this sense, Original Sin is not what we have done but what we could and will do which makes us unclean.", 
				" It is our spiritual condition. It is through baptism at any age that cleanses one of Original Sin.", 

				"In a physical sense how can we see the regenerative abilities in baptism? I would say that in ", 
				"(2 Kings 5:14) we can see the power of water and the Holy Spirit at work. For baptism is a regeneration of the soul,", 
				" we can see the regenerative qualities in Naaman’s joy of being healed. ", 
				" It was prophesized that Lord would come to pour out his water and his spirit upon the people.", 
				" (Isaiah 44:3) For the Lord will sprinkle water upon us to clean us of our sins and idols. ", 
				" The Lord will give us a new heart and a new spirit and as such you will obey the statutes and the judgments of the Lord. (Ezekiel 36:25-27)", 
				"We know this to be important for Paul reminds us of this verse in (Hebrews 10:22)", 
				" for we shall have our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and we shall wash our bodies with pure water.", 
				" So Christ being perfect from the beginning would have had no need for baptism but he shows us for example and in the fulfillment of scripture.", 
				" In this way Christ revealed who he was to the people of Israel. John the son of a Levite announces Christ king for he is the Son of David.", 
				" We can see the parallels in (1 Kings 1:39) and so we can now understand the significance of Christ’s baptism.", 
				" Never-the-less upon the baptism of Christ the image of a dove descended upon Christ, the Holy Spirit. (John 1:32)", 

				"Christ commands us to be “Born Again” in order to see the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3)", 
				" Christ explains that one is Born Again through water and the Holy Spirit. (John 3:5)", 
				" After this teaching Christ’s disciples begin baptizing with water. (John 3:22).", 
				" For John the Baptist declared that the one after him would baptize with water and with fire.", 
				" That fire being the Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that Christ’s disciples baptized more converts than even John the Baptist. (John 4:1)", 

				"The necessity of baptism with the use of water is realized by the eunuch after he is converted by Phillip on his journey.", 
				" (Acts 8:36) Indeed for how can any man forbid the use of water, to forbid baptism, to forbid the receiving of the Holy Spirit? ", 
				" (Acts 10: 47) For the water washes away our sins and causes the regeneration of the self. (Acts 22: 16)(Titus 3:5-6)", 

				"Even so I am suspicious that there is a war of words concerning the Biblical significance of baptism. ", 
				"Could baptism be simply a symbolic ceremony? I tell you that the Bible says otherwise.", 

				"It is the command of Christ to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and in the Holy Spirit to all nations.", 
				" For this power is granted to the disciples by Christ for he has power over heaven and the earth. ", 
				" We as Disciples of Christ shall teach the Word of God and observe every command Christ has given us. ", 
				" In this way baptism is not merely a ceremony or a ritual but has meaning. ", 
				" For if baptism is simply a symbolic reenactment for what reason do you baptize in the name of the three persons of God? (Matthew 28:19-20)", 

				"For baptism to have meaning we must repent of our sins before receiving it.", 
				" For as Peter said baptism is the way to receive the Holy Spirit.", 
				" And this promise of salvation through baptism is to the people being baptized and to the next generation and so on. ", 
				" As such the promise of baptism did not end with the first generation; it still exists for us today until the end of time. (Acts 2:38-39)", 

				"Belief and Baptism is necessary for salvation for one who does not will be damned. (Mark 16:16)", 
				"It is not just belief for even demons acknowledge God but the water and Spirit of baptism.", 

				"The phrase Born Again is “anothen” which literally means “begotten from above.” As such baptism truly grants salvation (John 3:3, 5)", 

				"For belief is the only thing necessary for salvation why do all the people stay to be baptized in Acts 8:12-13. ", 
				"It is one thing to believe, one must pledge allegiance to Christ. It is one thing to acknowledge but another to serve.", 
				" Do you hear and not do? Do you believe but have no Spirit in you?", 
				"Be not like the confused hosts of Paul for he asks them if they have received the Holy Spirit. ", 
				"More importantly why does Paul even ask? If baptism is symbolic that why would he ask if they have received the Holy Spirit?", 
				" They believe, this is true, but they do not have the Holy Spirit present in them. For they have been baptized by John,", 
				" a baptism of repentance. For it was John’s baptism that was only of water. That baptism was symbolic,", 
				" in that way the people could symbolically wash themselves of their sins. Why is this not enough?", 
				" It is due to the fact that Christ would come to baptize with water and with fire. ", 
				" And for this reason this host family is immediately baptized and in so doing so they provide proof of the Spirit’s work.", 
				" You can see that that they spoke in tongues and prophesied after the baptism. (Acts 19:1-6)", 

				"Acts 19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: ", 
				"and finding certain disciples,2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? ", 
				"And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 3 And he said unto them, ", 
				"Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism. 4 Then said Paul, ", 

				"John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him", 
				", that is, on Christ Jesus. 5 When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.", 
				" 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.", 

				"Paul who decided to give his life to Christ after being converted on the road to Damascus was still baptized.", 
				" For what reason if he was saved? For what reason if he believed? He was baptized for the cleansing of his many sins. (Acts 9:18)", 

				"Acts 22:16 gives further evidence of the washing away of sin even onto Paul who converted on the road to Damascus. ", 
				"So thus all people converted and all people who believe shall be baptized. We shall also die in Christ through baptism and not die in death. (Romans 6:4)", 

				"At one time we too were sinners but now we are washed from sin, ", 
				"we are sanctified in baptism and we are justified in the name of Christ, ", 
				"and by the Spirit of our God. In this way Baptism is necessary for the washing away of sins and it seals us as a follower of Christ. (1 Cor. 6:11)", 

				"Again, baptism is not symbolic for in baptism Christ dwells within us, we put on Christ in our souls.", 
				" (Gal. 3:27) It is not through the righteousness that we have done or according to Christ’s mercy that we are saved.", 
				" Rather we are saved by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. ", 
				" In this way we are justified by grace which gives eternal life. (Titus: 3:5-7)", 
				" The act of baptism allows for good conscience toward God, it is not symbolic. (1 Peter 3:21)", 

				"There are two exceptions to the water baptism and that is (baptism by desire) and (baptism by blood). ", 
				"The good thief is not baptized but shows a great desire to be remembered by Christ in his last hours.", 
				" In this way he is promised paradise which is not the same as heaven but the righteous dead.", 
				" As such the good thief by his desire is destined for heaven with Christ’s resurrection.", 
				"Baptisms by desire are for those who have died preparing for formal baptism into the Christian church. ", 
				"At the point of death a person can ask for a baptism without the use of water and is saved by this desire.", 
				" The question then remains as to why are not all baptisms treated in this way and I would say that the water baptism is the preferred way.", 
				" It is the baptism given to us by Christ and by his disciples.", 
				" It is the baptism that we can be sure without a doubt that the workings of the Holy Spirit are at work.", 
				" We know this because it was promised to us.", 

				"But while water baptism is preferred God is not bound by His sacraments. There is another baptism which is baptism by blood.", 
				" The baptism Christ is talking about is that of his death. In other words martyrs for the faith are considered saved even without baptism.", 
				" For what greater act is there than to die for one’s friends? Matt. 20:22-23", 

				"That said unless by unusual circumstances baptisms are to be performed as water baptisms.", 
				" I would also say that the evidence overwhelmingly presses that baptism is not symbolic by a real meaningful pouring of the Holy Spirit", 
				" and granting people the grace necessary to accept Christ and receive salvation.", 

				"Baptism is an expression of faith not a work. In this way it is not a ceremony, an observance that in someway pleases God.", 
				" It is not a chore nor could it be considered an act of charity. For if it were to be a work it would have to be symbolic in nature.", 
				" I also conclude that even if baptisms were to be a work it is legitimate for faith, in that faith without works is dead.", 

				"I also say that it is not sufficient to simply declare the divinity of Christ and to express that he is your savior.", 
				" You must have the Holy Spirit within you and you must act on your faith or it will be dead.", 
				" For demons know the divinity of Christ and they acknowledge him, thus they tremble, but they do not have the Holy Spirit in them.", 

				"Without the pouring of the Holy Spirit how can one perform demonstrations of faith such as speaking in tongues? ", 
				"Indeed how can one perform any work or demonstration of the gifts of the Holy Spirit without water baptism?", 

				"It should also be noted that Christ never performed a baptism himself, but why not if was symbolic?", 
				" Nowhere is it mentioned Christ performing a baptism for in John 4:2 ", 
				" it is specifically mentioned that he does not join the disciples in baptizing. ", 
				" The reason for this being is that why would the second person of the Trinity interfere with the work of the third person the Holy Spirit?", 

				"I would also say that there is a great deal of religious precedence to water baptism and to its non-symbolic importance.", 
				" Great theologians such as Martin Luther and John Calvin made their opinions known even after 1500 years of Catholic precedence.", 

				"“What gifts or benefits does Baptism bestow? ... It effects forgiveness of sins, ", 
				"delivers from death and the devil, and grants eternal salvation to all who believe,", 
				" as the Word and promise of God declare. What is this Word and promise of God? ...", 
				" As recorded in Mark 16:16, our Lord Christ said, “He who believes and is baptized will be saved;", 
				" but he who does not believe will be condemned.” How can water produce such great effects? ...", 
				" It is not the water that produces these effects, but the Word of God connected with the water,", 
				" and our faith which relies on the Word of God connected with the water. ", 
				" For without the Word of God the water is merely water and no Baptism. But when connected with the Word of God it is a Baptism,", 
				" that is, a gracious water of life and a washing of regeneration in the Holy Spirit, as St. Paul wrote to Titus (3:5-8), ", 
				" “He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,", 
				" so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life. The saying is sure.” Martin Luther", 
				"“Nor is it to be supposed that baptism is bestowed only with reference to the past,", 
				" so that, in regard to new lapses into which we fall after baptism,", 
				" we must seek new remedies of expiation in other so-called sacraments,", 
				" just as if the power of baptism had become obsolete... ", 
				" We ought to consider that at whatever time we are baptized,", 
				" we are washed and purified once for the whole of life. Wherefore, ", 
				" as often as we fall, we must recall the remembrance of our baptism,", 
				" and thus fortify our minds, so as to feel certain and secure of the remission of sins. ", 
				" For though, when once administered, it seems to have passed, it is not abolished by subsequent sins.” John Calvin", 

				"There is only one baptism for if it were to be symbolic people could and would baptize themselves several times during their life times.", 
				" Rather we are not called to be baptized again and again to be absolved of sins but in repentance.", 

				"“In Baptism we are given the grace, Spirit, and power to suppress the old man so that the new may come forth and grow strong.", 
				" Therefore Baptism remains forever. Even though we fall from it and sin,", 
				" nevertheless we always have access to it so that we may again subdue the old man. ", 
				" But we need not again have the water poured over us. Even if we were immersed in water a hundred times, ", 
				" it would nevertheless be only one Baptism, and the effect and signification of Baptism would continue and remain. ", 
				" Repentance, therefore, is nothing else than a return and approach to Baptism,", 
				" to resume and practice what had earlier been begun but abandoned.” Martin Luther", 

				"While baptism is necessary for the salvation of man one must continue to have faith. Without faith baptism cannot save you.", 

				"“He who believes and is baptized will be saved,” that is, faith alone makes the person worthy to receive the salutary,", 
				" divine water profitably. Since these blessings are offered and promised in the words which accompany the water, ", 
				" they cannot be received unless we believe them wholeheartedly. Without faith Baptism is of no use,", 
				" although in itself it is an infinite, divine treasure,” Martin Luther", 

				"So what if a person was to be baptized without faith? What if he is a Judas, an imposter, one who is not true of heart?", 

				"How dare we think that God’s Word and ordinance should be wrong and invalid because we use it wrongly? ", 
				"Therefore, I say, if you did not believe before, then believe afterward and confess, “The Baptism indeed was right,", 
				" but unfortunately I did not receive it rightly.” Martin Luther", 

				"Now that you are armed with the truth and overwhelming evidence go out and advance the cause of baptism.", 
				" If you are not already baptized this would be the time to consider becoming a Christian, so close as it is to Easter.", 
				" If you are in the process of becoming a Christian I say to you that your reflection and discovery of the faith", 
				" in order to achieve baptism is not in vain. It is a necessary experience not to just be a number in a church book,", 
				" but indeed to be written in the Book of Life. While it cannot be promised that all challenges and temptations will disappear", 
				" after the moment of baptism you will be assisted and strengthened by the Holy Spirit within. You will be encouraged through ", 
				" the will of the Holy Spirit in those around you, the congregation. As you prepare for baptism realize", 
				" that on the day of it you are now a member of the church, the Christian community. You are the saved, the elect,", 
				" the faithful; you are one with the Body of Christ. You become a temple for the Spirit and thus you must act accordingly", 
				" so as to not defile the body which is the temple.", 

				"In conclusion I hope that when you experience baptism or witness it that you have a greater appreciation for its importance in Christian life.",

				"Let’s look at these verses and see what we can glean",
				"from them for our lives… and for our hearts!",
				"39 One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!",
				"In v.39 we can see the picture of a heart hardened by pride and selfishness. There is no remorse or repentance in this man’s heart…",
				"I believe we can look at this thief’s response here and we can see what is prevalent in the hearts of ALL of humanity.",
				"Many years ago in the cultural revolution of the 1960s there was a phrase that became really popular, “…if it feels good do it…”",
				"This mantra was revived in the ‘me decade’ of the 1980s with the continuing decay of societal morays… ",
				"but to it was added another equally debilitating attitude, “…I am a victim! I am not responsible for my actions…”",
				"Today we may feel that our society has spiraled downward, and in many areas this is very true…",
				"BUT when it comes to wanting what we want and not wanting to be responsible for our choices… this is a human condition",
				"that stems from the very first humans (Adam and Eve)",
				"When Adam and Eve were confronted in the Garden by God after they had partaken of the forbidden tree,",
				"the finger of blame and act of shirking responsibility began… Adam quickly blamed both God and Eve for his plight…",
				"12The man said, The woman whom YOU gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.",
				"Adam wanted to cast blame on God for bringing this obviously devious and deceitful woman into his life… she was his problem ",
				"and God gave her to him so ultimately, in Adam’s human reasoning…it had to be God’s fault. He blamed Eve, but also blamed God!",
				"God turns to Eve and asks her why she has been disobedient and she quickly blames the serpent and said she was deceived…",
				"13Then the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? The woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.",
				"Eve did not want to take responsibility for her choice and actions, just as Adam had not wanted to take it for his…",
				"Eve was basically the 1st person to use the excuse, “The devil made me do it!”",
				"The attitude and actions of Adam and Eve in the garden to being caught in disobedient,",
				"sinful and wrong behavior is to shift the blame away from themselves…",
				"Humans have not changed in this manner… when confronted with wrong, we don’t want to face it, we seek to shift the blame,",
				"and we don’t want to be held accountable/responsible for our actions. Like I have said, this is NOT a new phenolmenon,",
				"but is as old as humanity.",
				"The thief on the cross that chided Jes##s in v.39 wanted Jes##s to ‘deliver’ him…but offered no contrition or remorse for his actions.",
				"He simply wanted God… IF HE WAS GOD… to get him out of the situation he had gotten himself into and let him go on his merry ",
				"way doing what he wanted… when he wanted. There was no change in his heart, only a desire to feed his own selfish desire.",
				"This is like all of humanity when we look at it… now not all of us are criminals in the eyes of the secular government,",
				"but we are all sinners in the eyes of God. Not all of us are seeking deliverance from a death sentence here in this world,",
				"but we are all seeking deliverance from a spiritual death sentence in eternity.",

				"But also we see in the attitude of this man that he did not have a belief in Jes##s…",
				"the sarcastic tone of his comments imply that his cry",
				"for deliverance was not based in belief but in doubt… the implication here is that this man was saying, “Are you who you SAY you are…",
				"if you are then prove it to me!”",
				"People who are living a lifestyle that is against God’s standards… and they are facing difficult times…",
				"they shake their fist at God and demand that He deliver them, but in their hearts they are defiant against any godly standard…",
				"For the most part people living a life that is totally against God have the same sarcastic attitude toward God as well…",

				"was murderer and if he truly cared about humanity he would straighten out all the problems…",
				"When I mentioned the freedom of will and our choice of sin, he scoffed at me as being close minded and intolerant of those who wanted",

				"is of our own doing and we live in a fallen and a broken world where the saved suffer hurt right along with the lost…",

				"fallible and frail like humans.",

				"a person with a hope for an eternal future I think we can safely discount this myth or view.",
				"The second myth is more or less a variation of the first one. The person who commits S##c#de goes into a limbo of sorts.",

				"which ultimately leads to her taking her own life. In the movie S##c#des don’t go to heaven. They go ... someplace else.",
				"The someplace else is a kind of a personal hell or a holding place for S##c#des. A place where a person’s own imagination hold",
				"them captive. Now, I think that we can discount this myth as well simply because the Bible does not talk about a holding",
				"place reserved for S##c#des.",
				"The third and final myth is a very commonly held. Many people have been taught that if a person commits S##c#de that he or she",
				"is going to hell. This teaching is based on a early church tradition that has little foundation in the scriptures.",
				"Now I am willing to bet that a fair portion of the people here today have either heard about this tradition or possibly even believe it.",
				"In our weekly preparation meeting for this service CH Sellers shared a story about when he was a hospital",
				"chaplain and how he worked on the psychotic ward. In one of the group counseling sessions he was involved in the topic of S##c#des",
				"came up and he was asked if he thought that S##c#des went to hell. Zan responded that he did not believe that the Bible supported",
				"such a position. This immediately cased a great up roar, not only with the patients in the group, many of whom rushed out of the room",
				"to get their Bibles to prove Zan wrong, but also with the social worker leading the group. Keep in mind there were all kinds of people",
				"in this group from many different backgrounds and they all felt that Zan was out of his mind, the Bible must certainly contain a scripture",
				"that said that if you committed S##c#de you were going to hell. After all they had all heard that teaching someplace before.",
				"The truth is the Bible says surprisingly little about the topic of S##c#de. All total there are six recorded S##c#des.",
				"I have noted each of the S##c#des in your bulletin along with scripture references so that you can look them up if you like.",
				"The first recorded S##c#de is that of Samson who was a judge over Israel. He was captured by the Philistines and put on display",
				"for a party in a pagan temple. In order to end his embarrassment he pulled the temple down on himself and all the Philistines in it.",
				"The next two S##c#des were of King Saul and his armor-bearer. Seeing that he was about to be over run by the OPFOR he took his own life",
				"and his armor-bearer did the same thing. The third S##c#de was that of Ahithophel who was an advisor to the leader of a rebellion",
				"against King David. Zimri another king of Israel committed S##c#de by burring down the royal palace around him. The final S##c#de",
				"recorded in the Bible is that of Judas, the disciple of Jes##s who betrayed him to the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem.",
				"In each of the cases, the scriptures contains no condemnation for the individual taking his life. They simply say and so and so died.",
				"In fact the only place in the scriptures where a person might find grounds to say that the Bible speaks against S##c#de",
				"is in the sixth commandment, “You shall not murder.” One could reasonably argue that S##c#de is self murder, and therefore",
				"if someone committed S##c#de they would have in fact committed a murder. Such an argument is sound and it would be very reasonable",
				"to say that anyone who has committed S##c#de has sinned and broken one of the ten commandments. Else where in the Bible we are told",
				"that when a person sins, he or she is cutoff from God and cannot enter into his presence. In other words if a person commits a sin",
				"they cannot go to heaven.",
				"But here is a reality check, every single person in this room is a sinner. There is not one person here who has not sinned against God.",
				"Not one of us are sin free and therefore our sins cut us off from God.",
				"So, is one sin greater than another? Well God treats all sins same. In God’s eyes the person who commits S##c#de is no better or worse off",
				"than the person who lies, or steals. A sin is a sin and it separates the person from God. But we are not God and to us some sins are worse",
				"than others. S##c#de certainly falls into that category and so we who are left behind after a person commits S##c#de have to deal with our",
				"feelings, our emotions which is never an easy task.",
				"Now back to the original question, “Do S##c#des go to heaven?” Well if I were to end this message right now, the answer would be no,",
				"S##c#des don’t go to heaven, simply because S##c#de is a sin, it is self murder, but I’m not ending the message now.",
				"In fact I’m just getting to the really good stuff.",
				"I would argue that some people who commit S##c#de do go to heaven. But how can we tell which S##c#des go to heaven and which ones don’t?",
				"Well the answer is simple, God judges a person by his or her relationship with Him.",

				"We need to recognize God’s authority over life and death. S##c#de and euthanasia (assisted S##c#de)",
				"are not compatible with Christianity though they are forgivable.",

				"to survive that long—without them she will die in hours.",
				"A man has discovered that he has a debilitating disease that will result",
				"in the gradual loss of all of his physical abilities in the next three years. He will be mentally alert but trapped within a",
				"body that no longer works, unable to speak, to walk, to swallow, even to breathe. A woman discovers she has an inoperable brain",
				"tumor. She worries that she will be a burden to her husband and children as her conditions worsens. Eventually she loses all ability",
				"to care for herself and requires her family to clean her, feed her, and carry her. A teenager has lost her battle against heart disease.",
				"She slowly slips into a coma. As her heart weakens she is sustained only with the help of a respirator and other life support.",
				"Another man has been told by his physician that he has a rare form of cancer that has attached itself to his bones.",
				"No only is there no cure but the process of dying will be extremely painful.” (Adam Hamilton Confronting the Controversies, p. 65)",
				"A young man struggles with his sexual orientation. His family and friends have rejected him. He feels the weight of society’s",
				"repulsion and condemnation. Even his church has pushed him away branding him a “condemned sinner.” In the depths of despair he hangs himself.",
				"A mother watches as her only child is tragically killed. Grief consumes her, she is unable to work or even eat.",
				"She doesn’t want to talk to anyone, she pushes her husband and friends away. The medical bills from her son’s final days begin to pour in.",
				"There is no money to pay them. In the darkness of her son’s room she swallows every last pill she could find, lays down in his bed, and dies.",
				"One month later, her husband in hopelessness takes his own life. An older man never had time for relationships, marriage or family.",
				"His job was his life, he was successful and prosperous. But now he could no longer work, he was retired.",
				"He still woke up every morning at the same time. He’d dress and then sit down read the paper and watch reruns, ",
				"he had no place to go, nothing of any value to do. Soon he quit getting dressed every day and he stayed in bed more and more.",
				"He felt useless, alone and rejected. There is was no use going on, he takes a gun out from his bedside drawer,",
				"c@cks back the hammer and pulls the trigger.",
				"These are real life scenarios that happen in cities across our nation every day.",
				"You may have been fortunate enough to have avoided being confronted by them personally,",
				"but the day will come when you will be touched by a similar situation just as difficult as these. ",
				"It may be a parent. It could be a friend. God forbid, but it might be a spouse or a child. It could even be you.",
				"At such a time you will need to know what you believe about death and about how we die. If you are a Christian,",
				"the most important consideration for you will be to know what God’s will is concerning how the suffering face death and what is",
				"and is not acceptable regarding our treatment of those suffering and dying. In the Christian Advocate during the Terry Schiavo story,",
				"Bishop Lindsey Davis stated, “As a culture we’re uncomfortable with death and suffering and some of these end of life issues",
				"we confront only when we have to. That’s unfortunate because our faith has much to say about living and dying.”",
				"For United Methodist scripture, tradition, reason and experience provide us guidance and framework for all of life and death situations.",
				"Though the Bible never uses the words S##c#de or euthanasia which is better known as assisted S##c#de or mercy killing, ",
				"it does provide us with incite as to God’s desire.",
				"But before we go on let me address an issue that many of us have wrestled with, the issue of life support. Often in the course of medical ",
				"treatment for grave physical crises it is necessary to use artificial means – respirators, ventilators, heart machines – to keep patients ",
				"alive. Sometimes when persons are placed on life support, the days that follow reveal that the person’s condition is irreversible.",
				"Often family members agonize over the decision to withdraw life support.",
				"Some have erroneously called this decision “passive euthanasia.” Most, however, do not consider the decision to withdraw life support ",
				"in individuals who are dying and who can no longer sustain their own life apart from artificial means to be a form of euthanasia. ",
				"The key distinction is the difference between acts of omission and commission. In S##c#de and euthanasia it is the act – the injection,",
				"the gun, the pills -that takes the life of the individual. When we withdraw medical life support from persons who are dying,",
				"it is the disease or physical condition that eventually takes their lives. These individuals could not have lived without ",
				"extraordinary medical means. Though, it is important here to distinguish that food and water are not extraordinary;",
				"they are part of the natural order of creation. Individuals on extraordinary medical life support have already entered the death process.",
				"Life support is only postponing the inevitable.",
				"Turning off the life support system allow the individual to be received into eternity by God.",
				"That having been said let us look at the case of S##c#de and euthanasia. There are at least seven different times in Scripture when",
				"a person took his own life or had assistance in the act of S##c#de.",
				"Abimelech, the son of Gideon, in Judges 9 was a wicked ruler; he killed his seventy brothers in order to rule over Israel.",
				"During a revolt a woman dropped a millstone on his head, cracking his skull. As he lay dying Abimelech called to his armor-bearer",
				"and asked him to kill him because he did not want it said that a woman killed Abimelech, the king. The armor bearer complied.",
				"In Judges 16 we find the story of Samson who was deceived by Delilah into revealing his strength came from God through his hair. ",
				"Delilah cut off his hair allowing the Philistines to seize Samson. They gouged out his eyes, and chained him to pillars. ",
				"Samson prayed to God, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And in one last display of might, ",
				"Samson pushed the pillars with all his might and collapsed the entire building down killing himself and the Philistines.",
				"In 1 Samuel 31, Saul and his men were also fighting the Philistines, when the battle grew fierce Saul was critically wounded by an archer.",
				"He begged his armor bearer to draw his sword and run him through. When the armor bearer refused, Saul took his own sword,",
				"fell on it and died. His armor bearer seeing what had happened, in despair, took out his sword and fell on it likewise and died.",
				"Ahithophel, the prophet in 2 Samuel 17, was ignored and rejected so he saddled up his donkey, went to his hometown, put his house",
				"in order and h##g himself. Zimir in 1 Kings 16 murdered the king of Israel and took his place. When the rest of Israel heard what ",
				"had happened revolted and pursued him. Retreating into palace Zimir set in on fire, remaining inside to be consumed by flames.",
				"And then in the probably the most well known S##c#de account, Matthew 27 recounts the death of Judas, the disciple who handed over ",
				"Jes##s to the Roman authorities. When Judas saw that Jes##s was condemned he was seized with remorse and went away and h##g himself.",
				"Interestingly enough though, in all of those scriptures not once do we read that God because they had committed or assisted in S##c#de,",
				"condemned them to hell. In fact it doesn’t even say that the act of their death was sinful. It wasn’t until the fifth century ",
				"that Augustine argued that S##c#de was a violation of the sixth commandment, “thou shall not commit murder.” Later Thomas Aquinas,",
				"who was catholic and believed that confession of sin must be made prior to one’s departure from this world to the next, ",
				"taught that S##c#de was the most fatal of all sins because the victim could not repent of it. This is based on the fact that ",
				"if a person dies while they are committing a sinful act, they are unable to confess and ask for forgiveness.",
				"This is an incredibly damaging and unbiblical view. Do you believe you have confessed each and every sin that you have committed",
				"in your life? If it were possible to do so, then there would have been no need for the death and resurrection of Jes##s Christ. ",
				"There are sins in all of our lives that we choose to ignore or we legitimatize in our own self righteousness. There are sins ",
				"that we commit that we aren’t even aware of. You see, the problem with the view of S##c#de as unforgivable because the person",
				"was unable to confess is that it represents a gross misunderstanding of salvation. We are saved by the grace of God, not by works.",
				"We do not know what was in the heart of individuals who commit suice, what has happened within them that has sent them into such ",
				"despair. As we said a couple of weeks ago, only God knows all the facts, knows the condition of the heart and soul. He alone",
				"sees the degree of sanity possessed at the time of action. And He alone is the only judge.",
				"Sometimes in our desire to have things cut and dry, black and white, we run head long into extremist views without allowing compassion ",
				"and mercy to be present. And, unfortunately, the church has frequently erred on the side of judgment rather than mercy. Churches have ",
				"refused to host funeral services for someone who has committed to S##c#de. They have refused to allow S##c#de victims to be buried in ",
				"church cemeteries next to their family or brothers and sisters in Christ. In those instances the church has failed to demonstrate the",
				"life of Christ, they have lost the opportunity to minister to individuals in great need, and they have turned people away from the ",
				"loving presence of Jes##s Christ.",
				"Lewis Smedes, professor of theology and ethics at Fuller Theological Seminary summarizes his thoughts on the Church’s response to ",
				"S##c#de in this way, “I believe that, as Christians, we should worry less about whether Christians who have killed themselves go to",
				"heaven, and worry more about how we can help people like them find hope and joy in living. Our most urgent problem is not the morality",
				"of S##c#de but the spiritual and mental despair that drags people down to it. Loved ones who have died at their own hands we can safely ",
				"trust to our gracious God. Loved ones whose spirits are even now slipping so silently toward death, these are our burden.”",
				"Still, it is important to be incredibly cautious in our approach to the issue of S##c#de and euthanasia. Christians can not accept",
				"S##c#de and euthanasia a solution to life’s sufferings and challenges. God is the giver of all life and breath. In Genesis 9:5,6 ",
				"we are told that we are not to take life intentionally because each of us is created in the image of God and God alone has this authority.",
				"When we intentionally take life, we usurp God’s authority and we begin to “play God.” Psalm 139 tells us that God alone has numbered all",
				"of our days and knows them from beginning to end. I Corinthians 6:19 tells us that our bodies belong to God and were given to us as a gift.",
				"It is in faith that as Christians we believe that God is able to use suffering for our good and for the good of others.",
				"“Jes##s suffered before his death. He knew what it was like to face pain and suffering, and he knew what it was to pray for God to take",
				"away the suffering[ – and for God not to.] Jes##s put God’s purposes first before his own desire to end the suffering. Jes##s suffered",
				"immensely on the cross but God used that suffering to save the world. Suffering often turns us to God. Suffering and the Christians’",
				"response to it may turn others toward God. Suffering, mentally and or physically can deepen our faith and it can strengthen our souls.",
				"It is a key ingredient to life; it shapes us, brings out the good in us, and makes us what we would not have been otherwise. ",
				"God is able to bring good out of evil and tragedy.”",
				"We, as Christians, believe and trust God completely that he will be with us even in the valley of the shadow of death. ",
				"We face the most frightening of circumstances with the knowledge that God will never desert us. You see, the power of the gospel isn’t",
				"simply that God walked among us to show us the way that we should live but that he showed us also how to die. On the third day Jes##s rose",
				"from the grave. “Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where O death is your victory? Where O death is your sting?”",
				"It is in this faith, his certain and sure hope, that allows Paul in Corinthians to write, “So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer",
				"nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an",
				"eternal weight of glory beyond all measure.” This is how Christians face death and suffering not by wanting to end it sooner rather",
				"than later, though we may have those feelings at times. We face death and suffering knowing that our lives belong to Christ—that they ",
				"are not our own. We face death and suffering believing that in God’s good time we will be called home—we don’t have to hurry the process",
				". We face suffering and death hoping that God can use us and use our suffering, to let God’s light shine through us and to bring something ",
				"good from something awful and even something evil.",
				"I have faced many struggles and challenges in my life, difficult and devastating events but I have never felt the depth of despair that ",
				"can drive one to consider S##c#de. Nor have I ever had to face serious illness, lifelong debilitating pain or inability to care for myself.",
				"My heart goes out to all who have ever considered S##c#de, who have ever had to face the thought of removing life support from someone. My ",
				"heart breaks for those who look at euthanasia as a way out of being a burden to their family, who feel that their life is no longer worth ",
				"living. As a church we need to show tremendous compassion and concern for those in these crisis situations. We need to be there for them, ",
				"love them, hold on to them and help them get professional help if need be.",
				"I have not faced those situations but, I have seen individuals face death with dignity and hope in spite of very adverse conditions. ",
				"My uncle began preaching in his teens and kept preaching all his life even when his vision began to fade. He just printed his sermons",
				"in bigger and bigger letters. But then he was diagnosised with Parkinson’s Disease and I watched as it robbed him of the ability to ",
				"speak clearly, to walk or care for himself. I never once heard him complain about the disease. I never once even heard him questions ",
				"“why me?” In his final hours, as a family we gathered together around his bed. His respirations and heart rate began to race rapidly.",
				"Someone suggested we sing hymns or read scripture to him. As we sang his heart rate and respirations calmed and slowed. Each and every ",
				"time we paused for minute they would pick back up, racing as the beep of the monitors pinged through his hospital room. As we continued ",
				"to sing to him it was on the promise of the song of Lord and Savior that he left this world. And it was at his funeral that his body was",
				"ushered out to the resounding joy of the “Hallelujah Chorus.” Even in ravages of disease and death he allowed Christ to be supreme.",
				"Let us pray:",
				"God of compassion, your son Jes##s wept with Mary and Martha at the death of their brother Lazarus;",

				"Say It With Flowers. Wrap up one rose for me, please he told the florist. Just one? the florist asked. ",
				"Just one, the customer replied. I’m a man of few words.",
				" A husband was told by the marriage counselor to try and be nice to his W#F#. One day he comes home from work.",
				"He does the dishes, vacuums the house, and does all of the dusting and laundry. He’s dressed up in a suit,",
				"he has cologne on, and he has a bouquet of flowers and a box of candy in his hands. He’s trying to make a good impression.",
				"The W#F# says, Oh, I can’t believe it! Little Johnny has been throwing up; the dishwasher just broke;",
				"your parents are coming to visit this weekend and to top it all off, you come home drunk!",
				"Sometimes we have a hard time expressing love don’t we?",
				" What is love? The word conjures up all kinds of different pictures. Is love a feeling or an action? For some love is flowers, ",
				"candy and gifts. To some love is getting what you want from people when you give them something.",
				"For some love is an inanimate object such as a car, a house. This object will give them pleasure.",
				" Where did love come from? Did it evolve?",
				" What does it mean to tell someone that you love them? When we tell someone that we love them, ",
				"we can mean anything from “I really like you a lot”, to “I really like what you do for me” to “I want to commit my life to you.”",
				" 1 JOHN 4:8 says, “The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.”",
				" 1 John 4:7 tells us that love is from God. How has God displayed His love for us? ",
				"Why does God love us? Does God love us because of what we give to Him? This is t he type of love that the world has,",
				"the type of love that says, “I will love you if..”",
				" What is different about God’s love? What can we learn about love from God?",
				" Today as we are closing in on the Valentines Day holiday I want us to take a look at another attribute of our awesome God, love.",
				" I want us to see three things about the love that God has for us. The type of love that God has for you is a true love; ",
				"it is not a selfish love that only loves you because you have something to offer. God’s love is a deep love,",
				"it is a love that we can look to as an example of the type of love that we are to have for the people around us.",
				"SERMON",
				"GOD’S LOVE IS:",
				"I. SACRIFICIAL (1 JOHN 3:16, PHILIPPIANS 2:7-FF)",
				" God’s love is a different kind of love than what the world teaches us. God’s love is agape love. ",
				"This type of love means to do what is spiritually best for another because the one doing the loving sees something of value in that person.",
				" The world’s system of love tells you that if do not get what YOU want out of a relationship that you need to move on to the next one.",
				"In our wedding vows we talk about for better or worse for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.",
				"What this part of the vow means is that I am going to love you sacrificially. I may have to give something up to love you.",
				" God loved us so much that He sacrificed a lot to show us His love for us.",
				" 1JO 3:16 We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.",
				" What did God have to gain by sending His son for us? Would you intentionally allow your son or daughter die for someone else? ",
				"It reminds me of the story of a young boy and his sister.",
				"A little boy was told by his doctor that he could save his sister’s life by giving her some blood. The six-year-old girl was near death,",
				"a victim of disease from which the boy had made a marvelous recovery two years earlier.",
				"Her only chance for restoration was a blood transfusion from someone who had previously conquered the illness.",
				"Since the two children had the same rare blood type, the boy was the ideal donor.",
				"Johnny, would you like to give your blood for Mary? the doctor asked.",
				"The boy hesitated. His lower lip started to tremble. Then he smiled, and said, Sure, Doc. I’ll give my blood for my sister.",
				"Soon the two children were wheeled into the operating room-",
				"-Mary, pale and thin; Johnny, robust and the picture of health.",
				"Neither spoke, but when their eyes met, Johnny grinned.",
				"As his blood siphoned into Mary’s veins, one could almost see new life come into her tired body.",
				"The ordeal was almost over when Johnny’s brave little voice broke the silence, Say Doc, when do I die?",
				"It was only then that the doctor realized what the moment of hesitation, the trembling of the lip, had meant earlier.",
				"Little Johnny actually thought that in giving his blood to his sister he was giving up his life! And in that brief moment,",
				"he had made his great decision! Sadly they both died.",
				" Jes##s said in JOHN 15:13 Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. ",
				"This little boy actually was willing to lay his life down for his sister.",
				" Jes##s sacrificed His life for ours. God could have turned His back on you when you decided not to live you ",
				"life that way that God wants you to live, but He didn’t.",
				" As we look at the scriptures not only do we find that God sacrificed His son for us but in Philippians 2:4-8 ",
				"we see that Jes##s gave up the glory of Heaven to come here so that we could have the opportunity to receive eternal life.",
				" The world tells you that you should have it all, God tells you that true love requires sacrifice. I am not just speaking of love ",
				"within marriage, but love for people in general.",
				" There will be times that our love for others will cost us something, your love for your children will cost you time and money. ",
				"If your children cause you some embarrassment, will you still love them? We have embarrassed God, but He still loves us.",
				"In the story of the prodigal son, you know the father must have suffered some embarrassment over his son leaving to live the wild life,",
				"but when the son returned, the father accepted him.",
				" Some young men and women need to realize that when they get married, ",
				"they are sacrificing their days of running wild or running with the boys. ",
				"The husband’s love for his W#F# should make him want to settle down and spend time with his family ",
				"instead of running and boozing with the boys.",
				" Some people feel that you can love with no strings attached, but God’s true love has the string of sacrifice attached to it.",
				"GOD’S LOVE IS:",
				"II. UNCONDITIONAL (ROMANS 5:5-8)",
				"Hettie Green was a famous millionaire. She lived in seclusion and became a virtual recluse.",
				"She had only a few friends and an ugly mongrel dog that kept biting the few friends she did have.",
				"One of them said, You’ve got to get rid of that dog. Hettie refused. She said, ",
				"That dog loves me and he doesn’t even know how rich I am.",
				" Let’s look at Romans 5:5-8 together for a moment.",
				" Verse 5 tells us that God’s love has been poured out to us through the Holy Spirit.",
				" Verse six tells us that while we were still helpless, Christ died for us.",
				"The word helpless means that we had NOTHING to offer to God, but God’s love was such that even though we had nothing to give to Him,",
				"He still send His son to die for us.",
				"Verses 7-8 makes the case that normally a person would not even allow themselves to die for even a righteous person,",
				"but God sent His son to die for us while we were still sinners.",
				" You need to realize that God despises sin, but He loves us unconditionally. Our world tells us ",
				"that you should be able to receive something for the love that you give. The worlds love us conditional.",
				"In 1995, Christopher Reeve, the Superman actor, fell from a horse in a riding accident that severed his spinal ",
				"cord and paralyzed him from the shoulders down. In the days which followed both he and his mother considered pulling ",
				"the plug on his life support system.",
				"In his new memoir Still Me, which recounts how he battled back from the accident, Reeve said he first shared his thoughts",
				"with his W#F#, Dana. I mouthed my first lucid words to her: ’Maybe we should let me go,’ he recalled.",
				"But his W#F#, through tears, persuaded him to fight back, saying, I want you to know that I will be with you for the long haul",
				", no matter what. You’re still you, and I love you.",
				" Think about the life that Mrs. Reeves was in for, yet she sacrificially and unconditionally loved her husband.",
				" God’s love goes way beyond all that man would do or conceive and commends His love to us as deeper, stronger and purer",
				"than the human hearts can know.",
				" It is easy for those of us who are saved to know that God loves us because we are trying to live for and please Him,",
				"but we need to understand is that God loves all people unconditionally. The person who is getting tanked up on the barstool",
				"last night is still loved by God.",
				" This love does not mean that God likes what the person is doing or that love equals heaven, but the Bible tells us in 1 Timothy 2:4 ",
				"that God desires all to come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved, despite what we have been done.",
				" Sometimes love will require us to be tough. When a husband or W#F# abandons, abuses or commits adultery, ",
				"your love for them at some point my require you to leave so that they will wake up and change. God loves us enough that He will not",
				"force you into heaven, if you do not want to go, He will not make you go.",
				" The opportunity for salvation is an example of God’s unconditional love for you.",
				" The worlds love has conditional strings attached. As long as you give me what I want, I will love you. As long as you look young and thin, ",
				"I will love you.",
				" LUKE 6:32-33 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. ",
				"If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.",
				" God’s love is unconditional. He loves you no matter what you have done.",
				"You do not have to clean up your act before you experience His love for you.",
				" Living for Jes##s in one sense is tough because you start thinking about how your actions reflect upon Jes##s, ",
				"but on the other hand it is easy when you can allow yourself to experience God’s love for you and turn your life over to Him.",
				" I have heard a statement that I have always liked, LET GO AND LET GOD.",
				" God always has your best interests in mind, let Him love you, let Him work on your heart.",
				"GOD’S LOVE IS:",
				"III. PERMANENT (ROMANS 8:38-39)",
				" In Romans 8:35-39 we find that God’s love is permanent. Let’s look at the depth of this passage. READ and explain.",
				" VERSE 35- EXPLAIN.",
				" No condition of existence (LIFE OF DEATH)",
				" No beings (ANGELS OR PRINCIPALITIES) (Demonic or Angelic)",
				" Nothing in time (PRESENT, FUTURE, THINGS TO COME)",
				" Nothing in the way of powers. (earthly rulers)",
				" Nothing in space (HEIGHTS OR DEPTHS)",
				" Nothing in creation (ANY CREATED THING)",
				" But God, I have lived a terrible life! God still loves you.",
				" But God, I have allowed the devil to run my life! God still loves you.",
				" But God, I have worshipped the creation instead of you! God still loves you.",
				" But God, in the future I do not know if I can follow you! God still loves you.",
				" Here is the point. Quit making up excuses as to why you will not allow God to love you. God loves you no matter what,",
				"God loved you so much that He provided a way through Jes##s so that you can be with Him for eternity.",
				" Let God love you. His love NEVER ends. God will love you if you decide to reject Him. God will always love you, ",
				"but do not mistake that love for a ticket to heaven.",
				" You can reject God’s love, but God will still love you. God loved you enough to give you a free will. ",
				"God was willing to let you decide if you are going to love Him back.",
				"CONCLUSION",
				" The love of the world is a self-centered love; it is a love that basically says that if you can deliver for me, ",
				"I will love you. God says, I love you sacrificially, (in other words, God’s love for you cost Him something).",
				" God says that He loves you unconditionally. That is that God loves you no matter what you have or will do.",
				" God says that His love for you transcends time. God will always love you.",
				" I am so glad that we can look to God to see how we are to love each other.",
				" In Ephesians husbands are told to love their wives as Christ loved the church.",
				" Jes##s gave His all for the church; He did what was best for the church.",
				" God’s type of love, agape, always does what is spiritually best for someone.",
				" If a person loves you the way that God loves you, they will not use you and they will always be looking out for what s best for you."
